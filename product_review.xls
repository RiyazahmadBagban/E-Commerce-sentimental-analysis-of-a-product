Really impressed with the fastest delivery of Amazon. I ordered it on yesterday at 2pm and they delivered me at 6pm on the same day.It is awesome.. really loved it..it doesn't fall from the ear and sound..calling quality.. Bluetooth connection every thing is great.Please go for it without any single thought.
This is the second time I am writing this review. Not sure why my earlier detailed review which was more like a ownership review was deleted by Amazon. Hope this review is published and not eventually deleted however this review would not be as detailed as the previous one. Purchased this product in Aug 2020 and since then had 3 replacements from Boat within a year. Each unit would last 3 to 4 months max depending upon the usage and always one or the other earpiece would die out. The left earpiece of the 3rd replacement died out 2 days back. Please note I have mostly used them during my morning jogging/running. Over all the sound quality is good and enjoy them as long as they last but the overall durability of the device is very very poor. Attaching the 3 earpiece chargers as a proof.
"1. Quite good look2. Better noise cancellation, good base.3. Quite lighter, fixes in the ear well4. Inspite having bluetooth 5.0, Doesn't connect to two Device at same time. I had bought it to use it with my honor smart watch along with my mobile but couldn't do so.5. No charging cable, No ear buds of different size, Nothing extraa given.Can't comment on battery backup. Seemed good."
"its a good set of ear buds but1. the quality of sound gets bad when connected with macbook2. due to absence of dual mic noise cancellation, it becomes very difficult to use it during a call as the other person hears lot of envt. noiseinability to use it during the call is the one big major disadvantage for this pair but other features are good like instant connection with mobile etc"
"I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.My priorities were like this -1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.(I'm an audiophile but was ready to compromise cuz budget :P)2. Type C Charging - I use a Oneplus 6T so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. Shoudn't feel bulky in the ears.And then I got these buds, and here goes my feedback -1. First Impression - They look great, love the red and black color tone.2. Fits well in the ears without feeling bulky.3. Not super satisfied with the audio quality, felt it was too Bass heavy(Found a fix with Equaliser settings).4. There's no volume control option from the buds, but you can do it from your phone without much effort(Ain't it?).Fix to adjust bass if you're on a Oneplus Device -1. Fortunately Oneplus provides Audio Tuner to adjust EQ at OS level.2. Open the Audio Tuner and go to Sound Enhancement.3. Select Feat. JBL E1+4. Open Preset options5. Select Blues and Voila!! 🎯For other phones -I'm not sure about other devices as I haven't tested on them, but here are a couple of things I used to do on my previous phones to adjust sound settings. As most phones or music player apps provide equaliser settings, you can select presets like 'Vocal/Jazz/Blues/Pop' which tend to compress Bass and enhance Mids and Treble.Also, after reading a couple of reviews of other TWS buds, I considered changing the ear tips to smaller ones and surprisingly it boosted the experience. However, it mostly depends on the size of your ears so might not work for everyone.Do let me know if you need any further information about this, happy to help! 🙂Happy Listening! 🎶"
I received the product with some defect. The left side of the airdops was making unwanted sound which is irritating after each and every small  input.
"Boat AirDopes, have by far been the most champion looking TWS that I have invested in. However, it makes me feel that the premium looks are simply to deceive the customers from other core issues that thus TWS has.1. Connectivity: The connectivity is very poor and there is a lag between the video and audio.2. Battery: The right earphones, just don't charge. So, I have been using just one TWS since about 2-3 months.3. Warranty: There is no warranty on the product, and team boat never ever replies. It's absolutely impossible to get in touch with them. They are almost invisible. The aftersale services have been the worst. Actually, non existent.4. Amazon: This is the 4th review that I am writing. Amazon has been consistently deleting my reviews."
Worst product plz don't buy it you will regret buying it for sure. My left ear bud not working just brought it previous month.
"Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself. They are just buying Chinese products and selling it by their name.I have extensively used these buds for a month while doing workout and watching movies and listening music and below is my detailed review of the Earbuds.Pros:1. Great Sound Quality2. Great Bass3. Great Battery Life4. Fast ChargingCons:1. It doesn't fit properly in ears. It is just not me, 3 more friends of mine are facing the same issue. It doesn't fit properly specially in the right ear. Also, your right ear starts paining after sometime if you push it or try to fit it properly by rotating it in your ear.2. So, if the right bud doesn't fit properly so obviously you don't feel good sound quality from your right ear bud. Sometimes I felt that their is some problem with the Right earbud sound quality but then I realised that it is because of the fitting issue.3. Earbuds slips out of your ear when you wear it while working out due to sweat. It gets slipped when it gets wet due to sweat. Even when the earbuds are fitted properly they will fall out when they get wet.4. The company says that as soon as you open the charging box of the buds both buds gets paired between each other automatically but sometimes both doesn't gets paired between each other and only left or the right one gets paired to the phone or the laptop. Then you have to wait for sometime for the other to get paired.5. The range of the Bluetooth is not that great. Sometimes even you are in the range or at the boundary level within the range one of the buds will stop working and you will hear sound from only one bud. Most of the times it is Right.6. Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.7. My right Earbud stopped working after a month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.8. Last but certainly not the least, their after sales service is horrible. Their customer care doesn't respond to calls, emails, Twitter or anything. It is a pain to reach out to them. They behave like a roadside local shop.So all in all it is a good pair of earbuds but Rs.2500/- is too much for these earbuds. So I would not suggest to buy this pair of Earbuds at this price.You can buy Noise Shots or Noise Shots XO and those are much better and you will enjoy the experience with them.boAt is Horrible and ridiculous."
"The sound quality is really really good.And the buds looked very beautiful and attractive.Specially if you love red colour.The green-blue flickering lights made it more attractive. Voice quality on calls is not good. You have to speak a little louder than normal which is not feasible at most times. And there is a lot of noise on and off calls. Because of noise during calls, i had to disconnect the call in-between and talk through my phone. This is not why bought this wireless earbud. And after using it for nearly an hour, there is pain in my ears."
"I received Boat Airdopes 441 from Amazon on Friday 19th June..But there's an issue. I hear a strange noise from left earbud every time I play something. Be it from YouTube or be it from a music app. Its 'hiss' kind of sound. It is only heard when I press play button and continues throughout the video/audio and when I stop it, the noise goes off. This particular noise is also heard when I get notification on phone. It is clearly noticed when there is silence in room. I googled and its called static noise something. I am worried now. Anyone else is experiencing this noise? How do I get rid of this sound? Its really annoying. Not finding solution on the internet. Please help me.I think I got a faulty piece. I will contact Boat customer care on Monday and return on Amazon. I want replacement with a goid, proper product.EDIT: I ordered replacement and received this morning. The new airdopes also have the 'hiss' noise. I think it is in all the airdopes. Dear boAt, you have made the amazing design for the Airdopes 441.  Also, the sound quality is best. But this noise has made me dislike the product. Sorry. Returning it."
"Honest review after replacing the first assuming may be received a faulty product, the second was even worst. 1st the call quality was terrible absolutely no clear voice. No bass at all. So did a replacement the second had the same problem. Second one the left ear bud had stopped working. Did a reset still no use."
defective left ear piece. Cracking sound on standby. Right side was ok. Very bad service from amazon. Left me with a loss of  500 rs after refund. I wanted a replacement but amzon denied the option as stock is limited. Never going to use amazon again.
"* It's my first ever truly wireless buds and the sound quality is very good. Bass quality is awesome.* Earbuds are really light in weight and easy to fit due to its ergonomic design and never falls off the ears.Though the case is bit on the heavier side but it's totally understandable as it carries 2600mAh battery.Rgb lighting and touch is very responsive* The instant wake n pair tech is really good within 2 secs of opening the case buds gets connected to the previously paired device.* I tried playing pubg and I didn't notice any latency , it was really fine.* While calling indoors the voice reaching is clear and crisp but as it has no noise cancellation for mic in outdoor condition or noisy environment will not be that good but still I'll say above avg performance.**** Battery🔋 review (after 2 weeks)Battery life is exactly what they have promised and I guess I got even more than that.I charged the case as soon as I got it and then didn't charge it for around 12 days and it's still working and on everyday basis I used the buds for 4-5 times .I used it for 5 hours continuously with 2-3 hrs of gaming and video streaming and still 30% was left.And if you use the buds at 55-60%(which I guess is the best because it's very loud) volume it will surely last for 6-6½ hrs.Buds gets charged very quickly I guess within 20-25 mins of putting them back into the case.The case takes around 1hr 15 mins or so to get fully charged.****** ONE THING I'LL LIKE TO ADD IS, I USED IT WITH MY MACBOOK AND I NOTICED THE VOLUME WAS EXTREMELY LOW BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF USED WITH ANY MOBILE, IT'S VOLUME IS REALLY HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MACBOOK'S PROBLEM OR EARBUDS'S, BUT I DON'T MIND AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS FOR USING WITH LAPTOPS I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO CHECK THIS ISSUE WITH SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING FOR USING IT WITH PHONES THEN JUST GO FOR IT."
"From the first look, they really looked very nice. I bought the red colour, and the red colour pops-up really nice.They Charging Case is also very nice looking.I wore them for a few minutes, and my ears started hurting.The fitting is going to be different for each user, depending on the size of their years and their comfort.Music lovers may not appreciate this, as it does not have enough bass.For people who would like to use it for official or personal calls, will feel that you will Sound robotic to the other person.There is also a delay in voice-over, which I think it’s not that bad.The noise cancellation is not there at all.These are much better than a few of similar products available in the market. However, it will be to each user to choose these based on their comfort level as well as their pocket."

"If you are a fan of bass like I am, hell, you are gonna love these airdopes. I have been using Boat products for a while and haven't gone unsatisfied even if I feel the durability of said products could have been more. Sometimes, one earbuds stop to work. Happened many times. I had a boat 225 and then a Boat 255 Pro. But they had got one thing in common -- BASS. I'm a basshead and Boat products are a sure shot recommend.Of late, I had been researching a lot of true wireless earbuds. I checked out several including Redmi Earbuds S, MI TWS Earbuds, Blaupunkt BTW-01, Realme Earbuds X TWS, and a few others. I settled, however, on Boat 441 Airdopes as I have built this trust factor with Boat products and am very skeptical of going to any other, especially Boat really offers their audio equipments at an affordable price. I watched a lot of reviews for these Airdopes and settled on it finally. I am usually a paranoid person, but I am glad to say that I am satisfied at the moment with what I have purchased.This is a 3-day usage review. I will edit this review as I pass the 1-month,  3-month and 6-month marks. On the basis of my usage, I will let you know why I recommend it.Let me talk about the Amazon delivery first. Contactless and on time delivery even in these pandemic times. So, salute to the delivery heroes who are functioning even in these risky and dangerous times. Salute boss!The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement foldable pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.The earbuds were at 80% charge when it arrived, but I had it charged full as soon as I opened the case. At 100% audio volume, the airdopes have been lasting me about 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is decent for this price. The buds fit extremely well, except that they have fallen off a couple of time (but that maybe because of my ears). However, I have no complaints because I really think I didn't insert them into my ears fully and that's why they fell. Regardless, they are also comfortable and even after 3.5 hours, I haven't felt any discomfort or pain. So, all in all the quality of the earbuds (premium plastic) is awesome. I will give it a 4.5/5 for comfort and build quality.Note: After 20-days of usage, I have no complaint regarding the fit. Although they do seem to come out sometimes when your ears get too sweaty. So, moisture might cause them to come out. But it has only been a rare moment they did. I live in Mumbai, a humid city, and I haven't seen them come out a lot. But it did come out a couple of times during one workout.The charging case is premium quality too. It charges to full capacity in about two hours, which is good. It has a neat finish to it. I love the black on it and the red inside. Yes, I bought the Raging Red option. Boat only has black and red for now. More colors will be coming according to their Facebook page. However, I have always loved red.Inside the charging case, the earbuds have their own slots. Magnets are perfect.I wish the battery in both the earbuds lasted more than 4 hours but that's what they tell us in their features list. So, it gave me exactly that. It does its job, but I wish it had a 6 hour playback at least. But then for this price, maybe it is worth it. I think this is where Boat lacks. It provides a minimum playback compared to its competitors.Note: After 20 days of usage, I felt that the touch sensitivity could be better. The one-touch pause and play works for music player but doesn't work for Netflix and Prime and other apps. Which is weird. It starts music player again if song is in player queue. Maybe if I do a factory reset, it will be better. Will let you know regarding this. It might be a problem with mine alone because a few days ago, the touch sensitivity was awesome. Regardless, the sensitivity is still top-notch. I am finding the functionality confusing.Battery Life: 4/5Coming to calling, I think it did its job good. I could hear the other person's voice clearly. And I could hear him too. So I will give it a 4.5/5.Note: I'd not recommend this for calling but it does its job. Noise cancellation is decent.Lastly, I am coming to the best aspect of these airdopes. The Sound quality. Bass is just awesome. Trebles and mids  are decent. Vocals are good. I just enjoy listening to the songs on these airdopes. The beats are awesome. They are more or less similar to Boat 255 Pro Bluetooth, maybe even slightly better. So, sound quality, 5/5.Overall, I think this is the best true wireless buds you can find on a shoestring budget. Fit, quality, sound, noise cancellation, all good. Affordable too. So, I do recommend these airdopes if you are looking for something in the price range of 1.5k INR - 3.5k INR.Note: Boat Airdopes 441 and 451 are not much different. So, just the color.And ah yes, forgot, these airdopes have got IPx6 waterproofing. I haven't tested it as yet and don't want to risk it, but I gather that it will protect the buds from sweat and water droplets. :)Note: I am now 7 months into using this. The earphones still work with the same quality as received. However, there's a little glitch. Whenever the battery percentage drops by 10 or 20 per cent, it seems to disconnect. It reconnects automatically, but it can get annoying. Doesn't happen every time, but there's a frequency. Tried calling on these earphones as well. Good quality. Earphones run for at least 3.5 hours and a single battery charge for the case gives at least 3-4 charges. So, all in all, good."
I am really having such a bad experience using this Boat Airdopes 441 product. I ordered it on 10th June 2020. It's  28th and my left ear buds gets discharge in less than 10 minutes. I tried everything possible to cure the problem. I am not able to even factory reset it. The seller  has closed the window of return. It's my third Boat's product but I am having really tough time with this third one. I don't know what to do. Product is under 1 year warranty but does it worth having a product which cannot even work properly for 15-20 days.
"Hi All,I have both 311 and 441, compare to both I feel 441 is compact.Cons* No battery indication.* If someone has big finger like me will feel hard to take out earpods.* Gets connect as soon as you open lid of box.Prons* Touch is really good* Not heavy and don't feel pain after using for 4 hours* bass is good but not good as 311."
"It’s my first AirdopesGot them for 2499/-As far as my observationPros1. Loudness is good not too much2. Call quality is ok3. Mono usage4. For one charge can use around 3 hrs with full volume5.No need of noise cancellation, literally we don’t here any outside noise unless it’s a train horn😜6. Serves the purpose like music movie calls no lag7. Charging cable USBCons1. Bit uncomfortable in longer hours2. No onboard volume control3. Touch sensitivity a bit slowOverall it’s perfect to me"
"I am really disappointed with boat airdrop441, really it's not more than 5 days I brought it ! And one of the airbud are not working properly and sound is not clear 😡😠 and it's really irritating me & making a buzz sound..... This is really horrible experience I had!!!!"
In the picture it shows the boat symbol on airdopes but On my airdopes it is written boat I don’t have an idea about it. The photo doesn’t relate the product. This is an illegal offence of cheating.
FIRST OF ALL THESE AIRDOPES ARE REALLY DOPE .. I HAVE BEEN USING THEM SINCE ONE MONTH AND HERE ARE MY HONEST REVIEWS ABOUT THEM IN SHORT..1] AS I AM A FITNESS GUY THESE AIR DOPES ARE PERFECT FOR GYM LOVERS..THE AIR FINS DO THEIR JOB PERFECTLY.. I DID SKIPPING RUNNING JUMPING EVERYTHING WITH THESE AND THEY DIDNT EVEN MOVED SLIGHTLY FROM THEIR PLACE.. THE LARGE FINS START TO GIVE PAIN AFTER 2 3 HRS OF USE..SO I CHANGED  THEM TO THE OTHER EXTRA MEDIUM EARFIN GIVEN IN BOX..SO THAT PROBLEM IS SOLVED AS PER UR EAR FITS..FIT -- 4.8/5COMFORT -- 4.5/52] THEY HAVE A AWSUM BASS.. SO BASS HEADS WILL DEFINITELY LOVE THEM.. ALSO THE TREB MIDS ARE GOODBASS -- 4.9/5MID/HIGH/TREB -- 4.5/53]THE CAPACATIVE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE GOOD .. JUST A SEC DELAY IS SEEN WHEN U TOUCH THEM AND FOR ACTUAL ACTION TO BE PERFORMED ..BUT THEY DO WORK WITH PERFECTION EVEN THEY HAVE SWEAT OR WATER ON THEM..TOUCH -- 4.5/54] TALKING ABOUT DURABILITY THEN I HAVE SAT ON THE EARDOPES MANY TIMES BY MISTAKE AND FELL FROM MY HANDS TOO.. ALSO THE CASE WAS FALLED COUPLE OF TIMES.. BUT NOT A SINGLE PROBLEM..DURABILITY -- 4.8/55] ABOUT THE CONNECTIVITY I WULD SAY ITS GOOD.. IF THERE IS NO OBSTACLE IN BETWEEN IN A ROOM THEN THE RANGE IS MORE THAN 15m... OR ELSE IT WILL START TO BREAK IF A WALL OR SOMETHING BIG COMES IN BETWEEN WHEN U GO TO OTHER ROOM OR FLOOR..CONNECTIVITY -- 4.5/56] IPX  DOES ITS WORK PERFECTLY.. I USED THEM IN SLIGHT RAINFALL.. IT WORKS PERFECTLY..IPX -- 4.8/57] BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS GOOD.. THE CASE CHARGERS THE EARBUDS 3 TO 4 TIMES..AND IT TAKES 1.3 HRS TO CHARGE COMPLETELY FOR CASE AND 1 HR FOR BUDS..AND THE BUDS PLAY UPTO 4 HRS ON 90% VOLUME..BATTERY -- 4.6/58] NOISE CANCELLATION IS DECENT... NOT BEST BUT WORKS FOR ME.. ALSO THE CALLING EXPERIENCE WAS GOOD.. VOICE IS CLEAR TO THE OTHER PERSON EVEN IN MILD TRAFFIC.. SO CALLING IS GOOD..NOISE CANCELLATION -- 3.5/5CALLING -- 4.5/5OVERALL THESE EARDOPES ARE GREAT .. IF U GET THEM IN PRICE RANGE OF 2000 TO 2500 .. GO WITHOUT A SEC THOUGHT.. HOPE U GUYS FIND THIS REVIEW USEFULL..
Some Weird Sound coming from left airdope for every small input which makes uneasy to use it. Also observed that some more time taken to charge and drains fast left side airdopes. Seems faulty peace. After waited for so many days to get delivery I got faulty peace. I am very much disappointed
"I'm writing this one, as a follow up to my previous review/feedback.After around 2-3 months of following up with the boat customer service and after the complaint with the National Consumer forum I received the replacement for my original faulty product.Having said that, firstly the replaced product was not same in color and secondly this one was faulty too where the touch pad of the right earpod was not working.😠 Again being frustrated I raised another complaint with Boat. This time it took at least 3 weeks of time(which is okay with me as compared to the delay experience i had earlier) to get this faulty product replaced.Finally, I was happy with this 2nd time replaced product, everything in this one seemed perfect. But it has been just 15 days since I received the airdopes and now I find that the right ones battery gets exhausted within 15-20 mins after a full charge whereas the left one with the same amount of charge can run for more than an hour.I don't know what's wrong with this product or what's wrong with the Boat guys. This is literally frustrating for any customer. After replacing 2 times and waiting to receive a good product for more than 4 months of purchasing it still I'm hankering for it.All I wanted is to let you all know my experience with these airdopes. Now i literally realize that I wouldn't have purchased this product at all. I should have gone for some wired earphones which is far better than these or would have gone for some other company. I'm being cheated by Boat again and again.Customer service sucks... Neither they test a faulty product properly nor they test the one sending as a replacement. Then my question is why are they sitting over there?? Why they take so much of time to get us the replacement???"
"Boat airdopes 441 pro model is having an issue in left earbud i.e. static noise issue ,I had this problem with my set so I returned it later I came to know that this problem is there for many others who brought this product,it is better if they solve the issue and re release the product,over all quality is excellent and the features are awesome,if anyone brought this and having same problem just return it because at first static noise is very low but in future gradually it will increase and irritate ,my previous earbuds of other company had same problem and I thought nothing will happen with that small noise later gradually it started to increase and it is irritating."
"Please avoid buying this as there is a constant hissing sound in the left airdope. Though it worked perfectly for the initial 2-3 days, the sound once developed is only becoming worse every passing day. Also, many other buyers too have pointed out the same issue, so I guess its a manufacturing fault."
There is a static noise in left ear bud.
"Look wise product is good ,but the quality of product is seems to be compromised by boat,Product which i was delivered has very low quality case, I fear just by using two days that is it going to be in one piece for month or two?Now let's come to product it self ""AirDopes""I used it for three days and the sound quality is good as compare to price and specs given by boatMajor drawback of product is its design it's feel heavy /bulky in ears after wear it for 10 mnt you can feel itching in your ears... Not so comfortable at allAfter three days of purchase One of ear bud stopped working and can't be diagnosed with hard/factory reset...Now there is no refund for this product... I'll have to stick with this product though replacement of same is under process."
"I was expecting something decent in the price bracket of 2.5k but the product lack basic features such as good noise cancellation and multi-device connectivity. Yes, the mic is worse the other person will hear a hissing sound while on call, I tested this multiple times the mic is really bad.Another issue is you cannot connect it to multiple devices, only 1 device will be connected at a time, now imagine you have airdopes connected to the laptop and if you want to receive a call, you will have to reconnect the boat airdopes to the phone.And On Top of this, there is no refund available on a replacement."
"The product is great in terms of build quality,sound and noise cancellation.Even the touch response is excellent so you don't have to pull your smartphone each time to change a song.About the battery it's pretty much good as it last for about 3-4 hours of continuous usage.The major feature is the bluetooth connectivity where you need not wait for pairing each time ,once BT switched on it automatically connects.!!!Just order without any hesitation and you will realise the value for money of this product"
Built quality is excellent. Sound quality is also good but the inbuilt mic receipting quality is extremely poor. Opposite person can't hear my voice clearly. He said too much echo and hissing sound us coming.Amazon please return my money taking back this product. Please cooperate.
True reviewPros:They look pretty good with nice build qualityGood baseGood microphoneDecent batteryCons:They really hurt alot in ears beacuse they have a really annoying adjustabilityThey miss out tracks in betweenJust don’t buy them waste of money instead try realme wireless earphones or oneplus bullets z which cost much less and are really better than these.
"1st thing is 1st.Amazon and the seller could have mentioned easily  mentioned that it's made in china and complied with govt. Guidelines but they didn't.It says Made in P.R.C. that's ""People's Republic of China""I feel cheated, because if I would have know I wouldn't have bought it. Boat being a Indian brand, is manufacturing from China.The product is just ok. Not bad.(I am assuming Amazon will not put this review, let's see)"
"I ordered them on 27 June and received them on 28th.. they looked very nice .. but I wasn’t much happy with the sound quality .. on a full volume also I felt that volume is around 70%.. but since the product is replaceable only and not returnable, I thought of adjusting with the sound quality..But just within 2 days of usage it started creating problem.. the left earbud started disconnecting automatically while using and would not play any sound.. though the capacitive touch was working but no sound.. tried various ways - switching off and on again, disconnecting Bluetooth and connecting again, restarting the phone, resetting airdopes to factory settings but same problem continued.. it would play sound for some time and suddenly no sound and it happened only in the left earbudHave raised a replacement request and the product got picked up today -1st July,. Will update the comments once I get the new piece.."
"One month back purchased , now charging box not working .Quality of charging case box not good"
"Really amazing . Sound effects is really amazing .+ve1. Good and excellent sound quality with very good bass effect .2. Amazing battery backup . First time i saw a ear buds with such a massive battery backup.3. Very light weight , that not mean it may come out of ears . It was well fit and it wont fall out . Really gets a Perfect fit into ears . Since it is very light weight we can easily listen to music or movie for long hours no pain at all .4.  Connectivity . Omg i was quiet amazed with the connectivity , First time i can see a ear buds connect soo quick and easy . Pairing is very simple and fast . It has an option , when we took out the ear buds its automatically connects to the previously connected device and it works great .Blindly go for it . U wont regreat.Negative : wont find much ."
Music quality is average but the calling quality is very bad. Lot of noise is creating on the receiver side.  Not easily audible on receiver end.  Voice is not clear during calling.  Very bad product for calling. I want to return the product.
"Bought the boat blue airdopes. Used it for 2days and it was working fine. But on the third day the connectivity started getting distorted even in the next room even with bending and moving. That was very disappointing. Also there was a constant tr tr tr.. noise in the left ear bud which is very low but it is noticeable. This noise only comes when the music is on. When the media stops playing the noise also stops. The voice calling is extremely poor. The person on the line will get a lot of background noise and the voice gets cracked, it was a very bad experience. So it is only suitable for listening to media. Ordered replacement. Hope the problem does not persist in the replaced model too.UPDATE : Got the replacement. The left bud noise is still there. It is lower than the previous pair. It seems like the problem persists in all products of this model. Think just have to ignore the noise."
"The good:+ Connection is alright+ Build quality+ Touch controls+ Sound quality is also not bad+ Battery life+ Battery bank feature and type c charging are very welcomeThe bad:- THERE IS A CONSTANT STATIC IN THE LEFT EARBUD, its not noticeable when anything is playing but as soon as you pause audio its right there. Tolerable, but annoying.- Too big for small ear- Design makes it so the wings can irritate the inside of your ears if you're moving around.- Way too much bass, balanced sound is out of the window."
The earphones are good. Only problems are that it pains after one hour of use. Can't hear outside noise. Noise cancellation is not good. Capacitive button is cuts call and plays and pauses music while handling. Buttons are much better. Too much disco lights.Rest everything is good.
"Static hiss in the left earpiece when connected to device but no music is being played. Must be some manufacturing defect in the batch because the same problem arose in the replaced product. Other than for  this reason its a great product, good looks ,comfortable and nice sound.Have been using boat products for a while now so a little disappointed with this product.*many wont even mind the hiss,but its annoying once you notice it.** 5 stars for Amazon for quick delivery ,replacement and customer service."
"Recieved in two days after launch (priced 2500 during prime day launch, may jncreased upto 3499 later). Impressed with first look. Initially I was too confused in chosing earbud. From xiomi to  crossbeats to sony, I planned for everything. Unfortunately all had negative n positive reviews. So went for a fresh product and writing the review after 1 hr of use.Sound n music quality is good. Built is premium. 2600 mah case, type C charging is best. Ipx7 is added in pro.I bought it for calling purpose and I tested indoor n no one could differentiate that I was calling from earbud. So thumbs up.Hopefully in long run the review holds true!"
I had literally tried 5 Bluetooth earbuds before buying it and finally my search ends here. I am a deep bass lover and it has not disappointed me at all. Call quality is not good. If u want to buy it for frequent calls don't go for it. But if u can compromise on calling it is the best earbud....beleive me i had bought earbuds upto 5k....it is best in all of them!!
"If you are looking for calls please don’t buy this product, the voice cancellation is pathetic. It reduces your voice and increases background voice the other person can’t hear you at all.If you are looking only to hear music and video then you may buy this product."
"Got the product on 3rd Oct and by looking at the previous negative comments, there seems to be a quality issue with this specific model where there is a static buzzing sound coming from the left earpiece.>have tried different phones/tablet/pc - its happening on all of the device even after performing a factory reset of the earphones.Hope the replacement works fine.Edit:Got the replacement earpiece today and the issue is still there on the left earpiece so matter which device i connect to.Went thru other 1 star review and it looks like many people are facing the same issue with their product.seems to be a manufacturing defect.Returned it for refund.Avoid buying boAt products online and if u really have to, get it offline before testing it on the spot!"
"Just bought this boat 441 two days back. Here are my initial impressions after using for two days.So i am not an audiophile or something, but used pretty decent earphones from boat, sennheiser, samsung, sony, philips, mi, mivi etc. So after some research, i settled for this as it is not too much expensive. I did not opt for fast delivery, still amazon delivered within 2 days. Packaging was good and product was nicely sealed. Little surprised to see that the box was so small. It is funny that on the box very tactfully written made in P.R.C. The capsule shaped charging case is small, light weight, very much pocketable, and sturdy because of the build quality and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There is a led indicator defines charging status. Its nice to have a c-type port as it is future safe because nowadays almost every smartphones comes with c-type port. This comes in vibrant colours and i purchased the blue one. The buds are light weight and feels sturdy in hand. However, the fit was not good for me so i changed the shark fin rubber with the smaller one given in the box, also changed the ear tips to the smallest one given and now it fits perfectly to my ears. Well, fit is subjective, so i guess you should also play around with the extras to see which one fits you perfectly. The grip is really nice as i use it while brisk walking and doing little exercises and it never fall from my ears. Some users says there is some static noise problem but i didn't have this problem as of now. The touch sensitivity is pretty good and accurate, however, there can be accidental touch sometimes when trying to adjust the earbuds. I guess with time you will get to used to this thing. Now coming to the sound quality, it is definitely bass heavy with good trebles and vocals. The bass is not muddy but punchy, and didn't hurt my ears. Highs, lows and mids are clear. The sound signature is pretty good. Didn't noticed any latency during media consumptions, but can't comment about gaming latency as im a non-gamer. Volume can go very high, connection with my smartphone is quite fast and stable, range is pretty good. Didn't went outdoor, but indoor calling was good and the other party never realised i was on BT earphone. Once right side earbud stopped after i took it out of the box for a long time without connecting to the phone, but then i just put them back at the box and closed the lid and then after opening everything was working fine again. Can't judge the battery life as i am just using it for 2 days, but the buds charges pretty fast.Cons: Couldn't find any till now, and hope i won't be able to find any in near future.I hope my experience helps you decide whether to go for this earbuds on not. Thanks."

 I enjoy listening music like you. I prefer quality in the music. Few facts prioritise this product than others.1) This fits very well into the ears. They don't just drop off even during workouts, running. Since I'm a sports enthusiast I am able to say this.2) Coming to the quality of Sound. I would say they aren't the best. I'm sorry but thats true. I have OnePlus buds whose music quality is much better than airdopes. But OnePlus buds won't fit well. There will be chances of loosing them.3) Call quality is absolutely good when compared to many other brands of same price range in TWS category.4) These Dopes are best for sports enthusiasts who loves hard bass. If you are one then you would love them. More over they look absolutely cool when you wear them.Lime green, Red and Black are the best colors amongst the color options available."
It disconnects very often....its very disturbing while playing games or attending a call....had a great experience with boat....but this time i was surprisingly very dissapointed...sound quality is good but 😢😢
"I had lot of expectations on this product but sound quality is not very good and there is lag of one or two seconds while listening music.Call quality is very bad, if you are using this for calling purpose, please don’t go for it.If you use both of ear dopes at same time, there are high chances of one battery is going of and other is working, it shows the battery level are not in sync."
"No noise cancellation, maximum volume isn't that loud, bass is also not that adequate, highs-mids-lows are also average, charging time is also much less than advertised,its a bit difficult to take the ear piece out of the case as it takes auto touch or might slip, connectivity is good, build quality is also good. Overall sound quality isn't up to the mark as expected from boat. Only buy if you don't use earphones that often and only want to try truly wireless earphones."
Though the airdopes are awesome but they work well for some time only after use of 6 to 7 months one side of the airdopes stopped working. I registered a complaint since it was in warranty period and they sent me a replacement product which was actually second hand and that too stopped working completely after 2 months.
"The boAt Airdopes 441 Pro are nic , with good build quality. The Audio and Call quality is Good.But could hear a rattling sound in left earbud sometime . Some other people have also reported the same."
"Sound quality is okay okay.Left ear bud had a low hissing Sound whenever there is a bluetooth transmission happening like when starting a music, pausing, while listening also we can hear lot hissing in background when any music has in low tone.Comfort wise it's good, touch sensitivity is also good."

 Thanks for coming to check my review, I purchased this product in Oct 2020 and now it's been a year and today's date is 28 Oct 2021 and yet it is working very smooth so I can't stop my self by writing this review, above photos and video is recorded just before putting this review, products sound quality, noise cancellation, bass quality, battery backup is best than expectations. eardrops case is very small and light weighted so you can carry it anywhere and anytime in your pocket. it has long lasting battery backup so you can enjoy your journey in better way, according to my use (ie. 1 movie every day, game for almost half and hour, YouTube videos anytime, and some time songs) after fully charging my eardrops I can use it for almost 3 days without charging. Earbuds takes 15-20 min for charging in case and case takes almost 1 hour to get fully charged.Product look is very cute and stylish, also the silicon earplugs and  silicon side plugs (see the video) gives better support to fit it in ear.If you are planning to buy this product just don't think more, go and order it for you. Its really worth it to buy."
"Ordered it during sale, received it quickly enough. Pairing was easy, size of the charging case is nice and small. The magnets are strong to hold the buds in its place within case. Added bonus that charging case comes with usb C charging. Voice is decently clear for calls.Here is the problem, the left earbud has low hum/ringing noise. Like tr tr tr tr tr ..... when music is not playing.I figured it needed a factory reset, tried it. No change.Figured it could be external interference, tried it in open place and no change. It almost like they got quality control issue.Did a return and replace and new item is also same. I’m not sure if this is specific to black model or all models. I’ll be returning this and get something else."
So this was my first TWS purchase here are the pros & cons if you are thinking to buy it:Pros:-Pubg on the first day faced a negligible lag but after that is working completely fine.-Bass is super excellent.-Battery backup is also good & reliable.-Easy on hand experience.-Too smooth connectivity.-Very much comfortable in ear and will not fall in any circumstances.-While wearing handkerchief or a mask still other person is able to hear you completely on the call.-Calling is very smooth and effective.-Great touch technology used just read the guide to understand it properly.Cons:-Noise cancelation doesnot properly works while riding.-On the calls have to speak up a bit loud sometimes while in a crowd.Its a great purchase in this range in love with this one worth for such a low price.
"It offers many impressive features and have an amazing look.... The case has been given smooth finish in addition to that, it provides a small pouch to keep the case..... It's overall appearance in one is stunning..... Now coming to the sound, audio products in india are tend to be stronger in bass, but the Boat Airdopes 441 perhaps takes this a bit too far.... Though it creats an ambience around you but the punch and aggression sometime is very fatiguing at all volumes..... The fittings of the earbuds are good, and it provides two sizes of the  rubber around it, so it accurately fits for all sizes of the ear. So if you are looking for a stylish, comfortable and secure fit airdopes which can provide a  magnificent sound with enough noise cancellation in around 2k-2.5k budget then you can definitely go for it."
Ordrd 441 ProReceived in one day only Amazon delvry at bestBut but retrurnd the headphn the next dayCall clarity v goodBattry goodBuilt quality specially rubber thing averageNow main use Audio Latency which is not acceptable for me.. YouTube videos almost impossible to c it was so badI am surprised not one reviw has ths complaintSo my particular piece was bad i dont knw as i opted for replacement only but thy refunded instead
"I bought this product just for the Bass quality, but it has disappointed me in a big way..Pros.1. Good Sound seperation2. Vocal is clear3. Light weight4. Fit in almos all ears5. Easy to pair and connect to your device.6. Easy navigation through one touch.7. Good bass.Cons.1. Playtime is very low. It last for 2.30 min on 90% volume.2. Somtimes the sound starts cracking on full volume.3. Loudness ok but lacks in terms of Bass which makes you feel that you are listening to a cheap quility product.4. Sound quility nowhere near to Sony or JBL."
"Now who can Say, when you are buying from a Company registered as Indian Company with such a legends associated with a brand are ultimately importing gadgets from China. 😀😠🥺😂 and marketing it here with Indian brand name..It is Cheating - it is not made in India but PRC means People Republic of China 😂😂😂👈I am not against the  product, it is Awesome - well designed, good quality and superior performance.❤️❤️❤️"
"Pros: Bass quality is fine. Bluetooth pairing at one go. Magnetic box is efficient for securing the earbuds. LED indicator is functioning properly.Cons: Brace yourself-Bluetooth connectivity lost arbitrarily in between music. Call quality is not upto the mark- sound is poor despite adjusting call volume, initial and end parts of a call are lost with almost no noise cancellation. No gesture or facility for volume control. With no buttons and only touch maneouvred gestures it is very difficult to adapt to listening music or calling for long hours. Gesture are congested and not user-friendly.Overall I would like to rate this a 3/5 for a budget bluetooth earphone."
Premium build quality..decent bass. Overall good earbud.
I bought it on a discounted price of 2499.The Quality of the product is Good and the battery life on full charge goes up to 12hours. It also depend on the volume you use.After using a week i found that it was nit pairing one fine day then i got manual and Reset the air drops and it started working fine.It feels premiumIf compared to other air pods boat is Better then others . I have given it 4 stars for less Bass quality.I used it today when it was raining and it is still working. I have a Bose soundsport. And the only difference i found was bass and bose has Little better noise cancellation. For price range of 2500 this is the best Airdops / air pods
"Don't buy this useless Chinese made earbuds. The right earbud stopped working within 1 month of use...used only during my jogs..they say it's IPX6 but doubt it...they just stamped their boat logo on some cheap Chinese made product which they procured in bulk ...Morever the connectivity during bluetooth calls is also intermittent..keeps on disconnecting on its own...Go for redmi, realme buds...UPDATE: Received my replacement product after 1 month (picked up on 25.7.20) today ie 30.8.20 but that too also has problem....Left bud not charging properly, even after 1 hr in the case, left bud only charges 20%....Also left bud getting overheated even with 5 minutes of usage and discharges thereafter....What kind of company you guys are running...dont even check the products before selling them..would that mean i again have to wait another month for the replacement..You just take back your product and refund me the money.."
"Received brand new product but one Airdope was stoped woking suddenly. After reading user manual, I came to know that, I need to put that airdope in charging case. Then only it will work properly. But it happens frequently. Also base quality is not that much good as expected. Hence returned this product. Thanks Amazon for refund my money as usual on time. (Which takes time from Flipkart.)"
"When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441. Didn't want to invest a lot of money hence gone for it. I purchased it for 2999 and within days - it was priced at 2499.If you're looking for using these while working out - please don't. These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. This was my first ever purchase with boAt I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 1499."
"COMFORT:I wear it during my workout I was worried that it will fall but the wing thing prevents it from falling. It not very comfortable when worn for a long duration.NOISE CANCELLATION:Don't have to worry about it wearing off easily 👍🏻. Noise cancellation is also great it blocks all the noise around you (fan, tv noises, etc...).BATTERY BACKUP:Battery backup is great I use it every day at night, during the workout (1hr) and sometime in the morning after all this, I have to charge it every 8-10 days.MIC:My only concern is the mic, while on phone some people, on the other hand, have complained about my voice (too low and breaking) but it just may be because of my low volume speak, so anyone who have low pitch speaks you would have to speak a little louder.CAPACITIVE BUTTON:The touch buttons are too sensitive, so during a workout the song stop sometimes because of my shoulder or my shirt. Also during a call, if  I have to remove the ""AirDopes"" my hand would accidentally touch the capacitive button and the call gets disconnected (one solution to this is to first disconnect them from the phone first, then remove them).SOUND QUALITY:I have no complaints about the sound quality. The bass is PERFECT not too much (as seen earlier on older boat products, they fix it I guess).  The high and low are also clear."

 This earbuds are not working properly one light are blinking and second are not working .also earebuds not fitted properly in case.not connecting with my Gionee A1 light . frustrating product..don't buy boat 411 series."
"Awesome product. Bass is great. Sound quality is also very good. Cannot comment on the battery back up as i have received it just yesterday. But as i have used other Boat products in past, i can definitely say i am not going to be disappointed. Recommended!!"
This product is AMAZING!!!. you can feels the beats coursing through your veins listening to all time favourite bollywood evergreens is completely different experience . Try listening to 8d audio its so coollll . The charging is easy connectivity is also fast . Through one plus you can adjust the the bass etc type c charger is really fast . The packaging case is pretty useful and handy . Noise cancellation is on point if you listen to at 50 percent and above ( my mom was not happy w this) . Also i dance a lot and workout so its perfect for that once you fit it in you ear it doesn't fall off ( conducted my own test by dancing on uff teri ada)MUST BUYYYY!!!ILL UPDATE AFTER A MONTHTHANK YOU FOR READING THIS FAR
"I bought musili vv1 for 1999 prior to buying this. It's louder compared to this. But lacks in quality of sound. So i returned muzili vv1 and ordered this one. It's my 6th boat headset over the years and yes boat delivers quality.These airdopes are a bit of trouble if worn for over 45 mins. As many users have complained about and uneasy headache, I too faced it and had to remove it often. The headphones are not loud enough as one would expect them to be. So i tweaked my dolby atmos and max'd all the Equalizers to get the desired sound and yet it lacked somewhere. However the clarity, highs and lows and deep bass are great. It took roughly 3 hrs on full volume to deplete the battery to 50 %.Sadly It's made in china and I will be returning it"
"The boAt Airdopes 441 Pro are good, sturdy and good build quality.The Audio and Call quality is Good.But could hear a rattling sound in left earbud when not in use. Some other people have also reported the same.Basically Airdopes 441 and 441 Pro are same, just case and IP7 rating is different.The Case is heavy almost 3/4 weight of a phone and is big, but with larger battery capacity.If you are Ok with 15-18 hours backup go with just 441 to save money.However this is also worth a buy."
"I think m the first person uploading black 🖤 color.For me I just Love 😍 the Style and Design, Cool multicolor Light in it.1.You found lot many Reviews But to B Honest It's Really Soo good under This price range2.Sound quality is Clear with Bass as You know bass is most imp in BoAt.3.Built Quality is also  nicely done here but little slipery the charging case is.5.One more Interesting thing I Wanaa to share with you all i use it while m washing Mah Face 🙂, brushing Mah teeth And you know  wht it as same as before in Mah 👂.This Much for now After using couple of days I will tell you more about Airdopes 441 I just loved it.. 👍🏻"
"I gave indivially 4 star for each, bcz I felt all of them works perfectly but the problem is after 2 months of usage it shows/does not connect with my mobile phone before it was very fine, not only with my phone and some other particular phones. Even I tried my best to connect bt it does not. But it connected with my laptop. I felt very bad about this coonectivity issue bcz I refered this model to my friends circle...and this is not first time, initially #boat product was good but later days in the sense after 2 or 3 months it's shows lots of issues...before purchasing boat product kindly think twice."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Pros,1. Good music quality.2. Fine bass.3. Perfectly fitting in ears. I used it while  riding bike and it's perfectly stable. If u  find uncomfortable try changing the buds4. Getting almost 5 hrs of playtime as mentionedCons.1. Poor noise cancellation.2. Found difference in music quality while playing music and videos. For videos sound quality is litttle bit down.3. Calling is only good in our home or calm places. Calling is difficult in crowded place or while bike rides or places with surrounding noises. Because the person towhom we are talking can hear surrounding noises."
"2 months of usage and previous unit replaced so updating the review.. the bluetooth issue is resolved in replaced piece, so overall it's a good product with balanced sound at good price if purchased under 2400*****Roughly 1 day of usage, bluetooth disconnecting soon as soon as u get little away from device.. or even when you use one earbud and keep other away with phone with you, it will cut u out.. that itself was worrysome but now I connected with my android set top box for TV viewing and it's not connecting constantly. Though TV is right in front of me 3m away. Even Boat rocker headphone I use otherwise works better than this.These things are not being told or checked in youtube reviews availble strangely, either they are paid reviews or they don't check thoroughly.Ear grip is good, sound is reasonable but when I was watching BBT on prime video, sound was relatively low. So overall it seems a good buy if u just want to use it in both ear with phone in pocket all the time or for some gaming. Call was disrupted too couple of times..Probably will return this unless Boat provides a solution to bluetooth issue."
"Product is very nice,  but one think is very poor, that is during the calling 2nd person can't hear clearly, they said sound are not perfect. They can't hear my words properly! The words are reaching them by echoing 😥"
"These in-ear head phones tick a lot of boxes for me:1: Budget2: decent sound3: Good Bass4: Average Noise Cancellation (due to snug fitting ear tips)5: The stylish lights on the rims which match the Edge Lighting of the Samsung Galaxy phones.If you wonder, why I have given them a 3 🌟 rating despite so many of my boxes being ticked is due to the overly sensitive touch pads.These fit perfectly inside the ear and don't look ugly but they are absolutely no good to me while sleeping.When your head presses against the pillow, either the audio/video gets paused / Google assistant activates or worst of all thar particular ear piece gets shut down.For me this was a major low  unfortunately no option for a half star so 3 stars."
"I would keep it short and pointed out:1. Connectivity is pretty nice - connects instantly on lid open.2. Seamless stereo/mono switch - works fantastic every time. No issues faced3. Build is pretty good - for the price, the build quality is really good. The LED is fantastic i must say4. Touch - the touch is just, well, too good. It takes up at any point, the slightest of touches and that MIGHT be irritating at times5. Sound - in one word, GOOD! Actually good is being really vague. The bass is punchy but not overwhelming. Bassheads will not be really sad with this. Instrument separation is good even though the mids are a little muffled. Pure vocal artists will lose the edge there. The punch will be really high in songs like Get Lucky, Madness etc. So yes, for this price point, the sound is good.6. Fit - perfect fit, doesn’t fall off. But sadly, very subjective, hurts my ears after 45 minutes or so. If your ears don’t hurt, go nuts doing any exercise you want.7. Passive noise cancellation - brilliant but with an underside of not hearing ANYTHING AT ALL from outside. So keep that in mind and do the needful when out wearing them.I cannot comment on the battery or long term issues. I have used it for my runs and casual listening. For the price, this is really a decent bud pair!!"
"Pros:1) nice fit.2) bass is adequate.3) Sturdy buildCons:1) the auto-connect doesn’t worked for my device, ideally it should connect automatically to the last paired device.2) the charging time is quite high.3) the vocals and mids are not balanced, this device is more bass oriented.4) the loudness could have been slightly better.5) Missing Equaliser mode.6) touch is bit clumsy and delayed, response time should have been better.Verdict: the top 2 cons could be manufacturing defects, i have requested a replacement. This is a sturdy device in my understanding at the given price, but definitely there is big scope of Improvement."
"Got them in prime day sale (blue colour)Using since past 2 days.Using themJust forget that it need to be charged also (both case and dopes). Just put buds in case while bathing etc or whenever you dont need them. Even after 15-20 mins they will again be ready for rock n roll.Music: nice sound, volume is enough and amplified, bass is boosted, after 80% volume bass is really thumping and overtakes other volumes.(If you are not a bass lover- just dont buy)Fit: originally fitted fins and buds were bigger than my ear and causing a but painI have changed to smaller buds and fins and after they fits better.Still NOT best fit, but alright.As they are on a bit tighter side in fit, there is just no chance that they fall off.They wont fall even if one is runningBut if you are using them for more that 3 hours straight, they causes pain in ears.Controls: nice crontrolsBut thing is they are very sensitive, means even on a call a slight adjustment just cuts the call.On call sound: just BADIf other person is on a good network with a good phone, they can hear you a bit clearly but everyone else, they just struggle to get your voice.Just not meant for callsMono use: both bids can be used separately for every single job, including calls also.If battery is a issue with you, just put one in case and use one, after a while start using other and put first one in case.Overall: nice purchase for 2500I also own boat rockerz 255 and rockerz sound is better than these airdopes. But these have almost infinite batteries.NOW ONE EARBUD STOPPED WORKING JUST AFTER 7-8 MONTHS.BATTERY OF 1 EARBUD GOT RUINED IN JUST 7 MONTHS"
"The product is very goodGood rather very good battery lifeType c is ❤️Fast chargingCompact fittings is to good (this mostly depends on ear fittings in different shapes of ears)Bass is great , treble could have been betterBuilt quality is great!!!And yesssss!!!!!At last mic is really good no delay experiencedNo problems in calls and online chatting in games"
"मेरे साथ Fraude हुआ हैमैंने इस product को खरीदा, product अच्छी नहीं थी जिसके कारण मैंने इस product को वापस करने के लिए Request किया। Amazon ने इसे return करने के लिए स्वीकार कर लिया और अपने Delivery Boy को भेजा । वो product delevey Boy ले तो गया मगर, Product ना तो Amazon को मिला है और ना ही मेरे पास है....बहुत-बहुत contact किया Amazon को मगर आज तक मुझे refund नहीं मिला।Please do the needful."
"The product is great, it has all the qualities your looking into a headphones... frist time buyer for these wireless devices and I think I made a right choice..Sound quality is great with real bass and hd sound with out any video lagging while ur watching movies from ur phone.Built quality is decentHad 6 hrs battery on the earbuds at the volume 80 %Bought the yellow colored for rs1999 during the festive sale.Got delivered in one day.Fits in the ear quite well without popping out too much, and can wear your helmet on it without any trouble and you won't have any ear pain while the helmet is on, as I have tried it on LS2 & MT helmets.Connects well with the phone and Alexa show 8, yet to try with the smart TV but m sure it will connect that too.Overall if u see they are many products in the market but if u see a reliable product which u can buy is this cus its stylish & quality while the others dont provide you what your looking for but u will be disappointed with something but one has it all...Hope this helps for the other buyers."
These do not fit the ear well and causes pain after about 30mins of use. No extra earmuffs includedAlso cannot use these for gaming too much lag.You cannot use these while driving you will not be able to hear even the loudest horn. Full marks for noise cancellationThe battery backup is not half bad but cannot use the airdopes for more than 30 mins at a time.Sound quality is good for the priceAll in all not a good product for gaming or continued use.
"After using more time , pain for earWhen connecting with my Redmi K20 pro , sound quality is not very best . Looks like fine only .Can't increase volume using ear buds is a drawbackWhen connecting with laptop , better sound experience.But comparing to other boat products these not giving much output is my review .Battery performance is good and 5 hour is getting with ear buds.And also wide range use also can, I tested while connecting with laptop and went 1 room beyond and closed door, amazingI am updating my review 17-12-2020 --> Battery life of case is not good now , as much of battery life is not getting now .So Think and buy ... After use of 1 month I am saying"
"So I bought this product from Amazon, honestly it was a bang for the buck. Nice fidelity, bass, comfortable and not so expensive.  All was good for a month and then one side stopped working, so I reached out to boat and they asked me to ship the product and they confirmed they received it. They abruptly cut all the ties with me after that, they dont respond to my emails asking status,  no response on twitter, helpline not going through.  The ticket number is 1540334 and they didnt respond to me for the past 1 month. Stay away from any Boat product, rather than that go for some brand who will respond to you or buy a cheap one and toss it of when stops working.Update: oct 25th. Finally they sent a replacemet earbuds.  So changing the ratimg from 1 to 2."
"Review editing after a few months of use: The mic on the earphones is very cheap quality and the audio quality over calls is pathetic. It sounds very muddled, as if you are talking under water. Another major problem is one of the earphones randomly shuts off within 30mins of use and cannot be used again before putting it back in the charging case. This is disappointing for me as bought these with the intend to wear them on long cycling sessions (min 1hr).I am an audiophile,  so would like to talk mostly about audio quality. I bought these for casual listening, specially for cycling in monsoon. The highs and mids are pretty decent for the price you pay, but when it comes to low frequencies, the bass is too boomy for my liking (note: this is coming from a guy who likes to listen to his music on vinyl). The bass is not tight and is all-over the low ends which causes highs and mids to subside. Having said that, they are decent pair of earphones and are pretty manageable (sound quality wise) even for an audiophile like me. Would have given 5 stars, had they kept the bass under control."
"Let's go straight to the points.Pros.1. Though it has 6mm drivers, it produces sound quality like having 10mm drivers.2. Overall balanced output of treble, bass, voice quality makes it a perfect choice under 2k. Even 2.5k doesn't really bothers much.3. Touch sensor never fails.4. IPX 7 protection is a bonus point comparative to other products under the same price range.5. That extra rubber around the TWS holds them perfectly within your ears n let's you be more confident to do your movements more freely.6. The magnets are really strong so jus relax they are not going to fall out of the box/case.7. Speaking on phone calls is a breeze surprisingly in indoor and they're quite impressive even in outdoors.8. Other features like led indications, auto pair, type c cable, good battery backup, light weight etc all together makes this product a paisa wasul one.Cons.I'm trying to find them out and when I do, I'll update my review for sure.I've used many headphones 🎧 already, n since I'm using this one it makes me feel like, aahh why didn't I bought it before! 😃Also bought another one for my colleague and the big smile on his face tells the story itself 💁🏻‍♂️😀"
"A wonderful product & worth buying it.As compare to other product in comparison, this product is way superiorAll parameters defined are very well covered.Main importance while buying these kund of product are :1). Durability2). Waterproof3). Comfort fitIn all parameters it fit good, I have tried it while morning jogging and also tried wearing while washing face.Also a good magnetic conteoll while charging.Shall also edit review after using it for 3 weekUPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS OF USAGESTILL WORKING AS BEAUTIFULLY AS BEFORE, I would say in this range this product has an amazing quality build & durability along with clear sound.Value for money product with good brand support"
"I bought these a few days back, and as soon as I paired it with my phone, I could hear a constant static noise from the left earbud. I thought it would go away after some time, unfortunately even after 1-2 days, it did not. I tried it with my OnePlus 5T, Windows laptop, iPad, all of them gave the sound on the left side. The right side worked without issue. So I thought it might be a faulty product and ordered a replacement, and when the replacement arrived, it still had the same issue. It is very annoying and highly noticeable at times like dialogues without any music/ scenes when there is not much audio in movies, especially at volumes anything lower than 25%. Above that, if it is boomy music, it gets masked and you can't hear it, but it is still there as I could hear it during silent parts.Apart from this issue, the bass on this is pretty unsatisfactory, although it might be okay as compared to some cheap wired earphones.Pairing is fast and works as advertised, and so does the battery.I found the noise really annoying and I ended up returning it."
Worst sound quality means the beats are low and this product doesn’t have good connectivity with the iPhone. Whn we long press for Siri the is hanging and the beats and the bass is not there whn we listen the songs it feels nothing special 😒😑 and now suddenly the price as been reduced to 2k decreased 500 rupees
I bought this on the day of release i.e. on 6th August. Had to place a replacement due to disturbing noise in the left earbud. Got the replacement thereafter from Amazon. The new one also had the same issue but very feeble. Thought i could adjust so used it for couple of weeks. 24th August both the earbuds stopped working and now i have completed the return/replacement timeline. Post which i had to order a replacement under warranty online in BOAT website which will take 20 days to complete. I am still waiting for the replacement. Frankly a pain in the A**

 Why I choose #Airdopes 441 pro over other TWS -1) 2600 Mah battery2) IpX7 rating ( 1 meter water ) resistance3) easy fit and doesn't come out while doing exercise and running4)Bass is strong5)2hrs movie on Laptop took 20% only.6) Case charge is also goodCons-1) if your phone or laptop is in one room and you are in other room. Then it will break sound . It's mean , does support no so longer gap connectivity**I'm not a gamer ... But it's perfectly work with my vivo 15 and old Dell Ubuntu and new Asus Windows 10 laptop."
"Guys, seriously, give this one a pass. This and other similar boAt products (Rockerz) are just poor pieces of tech which will remain in dumpyards and pollute our planet for years.These Airdopes actually feel like they're high on dope - sometimes they pair like a breeze, sometimes they don't. There are instances where the sound comes through only on one of the earpieces, whereas on other instances both work fine. The mic for capturing speech works at times, when it feels like. Otherwise, the other party doesn't hear you at all.I would rather save myself the hassle and spend a bit extra on a Sony/JBL which will actually work and last me for a while.As of now, I have two pieces of marble (the earpieces), one mini jewellery box (the charging case), all containing tech and batteries which need to be dumped in a landfill. What a waste."
"I use this product everyday, for media consumption on both phone and computer, and i use for phone calls as well. It went ok for first two weeks. After that, I had to regularly format it due to bluetooth connectivity issues. After 1 and half month use, sound transmission stop frequently to a point where it would not transmit any audio for as long as 5 seconds after every 2 seconds. I claimed warranty on Boat's website, it has now been 8 full days since then and I have not heard anything from Boat. No one has contacted me for picking up my device for servicing or replacement. Would definitely not recommend based on my experience alone."

 The product is amazing at its price of 2300INR when i bought. The main reason is for the cool colors which Masaba has designed. Other TWS is more of vanilla when compared to this.Coming to build quality: Im more than satisfied since after 6 months usage i have dropped it here and there but thankfully no damage yet.Sound quality is comparable to other market competition such as one plus buds, mivi etc.Battery life is commendable, after daily usage of 3-4 hrs and charging box 2 times a week.If you are for the looks and ok with sound quality dont hesitate go for it."
Excellent
the sound quality has no match for anything but the connection between earbuds is the worst... if you want to check.. puton your earbuds okay a song and cover any one ear with your hand of a pillow like in a sleeping position ... one earbud disconnects and squeks... the call quality is lower than i thought... a horn or a crore chriping at a distance can be caught easily... i sant it back.. defective product overall ... you guys should start taking micrphone seriously for calis....
"Pros:- Sound is OK- Heavy bass- Value for money (You get just enough value for what you paid; don't get fooled thinking you got a great TWS earphones at a bargain)Cons:- Painful: The casing pushes against your ear and causes discomfort after few mins. You feel like your whole ear is occupied. I have tried Airpods style earphones and they are much better. Only the eartip goes into your ear canal, and the rest of your ear will thank you for the freedom.- Useless touch controls: Horrible touch controls that just like to flash some colorful lights, god knows what is the meaning of the lights. You have to keep it continuously pressed and hope what the manual says will actually work.- Difficult pairing: The first pairing is easy since it is ready to pair when you open the box for the fist time. Subsequent device pairing is excruciatingly painful due to the above issue of touch controls. The instructions says long press 5 secs to turn off and long press 3 secs to turn off. The touch controls just keep flashing some lights and don't give you any feedback as to whether it is taking your inputs or not. Of course, it did not turn off as advertised."

Pros :1. Look2. Case Quality3. Bass4. Bluetooth connectivityCons :1. Very Low sound - in order to listen properly you have to keep the volume at 70% which is unlike Boat 311 V2.
Left earbud static problem minor but I have to return
Call connectivity is very poor. If its just for music go for it. We can hear the other person but the other person can't hear you at all.
"Pro-Good Sounding buds.For a balance sound use your system eq.Instant pairing option is really dope🔥Comfortable to ears.Now a days after service is better than JBL in my personal address,tht for i go for boat.Con-The toch capacitive bottons are annoying to my personal use several times every day.😑"
"Opened the pack to find a cute earbud. Was impressed with ease of use. The plastic on the outside looks cheap, but felt comfortable on the ear. Good look for the price. Was very happy on the initial use of work call and music during work. Trouble started on day 2, when I used it for workout. Even a slight touch on the left pod starts iTunes. This was a big annoyance as I was listening to something off iTunes. Then tried connecting to my Android, but it wasn't pairing. On day 3, when I opened the case, the left pod wasnt charged and ran out of battery again soon. Returned it to get another box, which had left pod charging issues repeatedly. Ended up returning that too."
"Just delivered. Started using it. Not going into techno babble, I am going to record my initial observations:1. One day delivery by Amazon. Got it at Rs. 2499.2. Great packing by BoAt, looks neat and organized.3. A bit heavier case considering the extra juice stored in the battery to be used as a power bank in case of 'emergencies'.4. Instant battery level indicator on the case by pressing an associated button on the front of the case.5. Instant searching by the pods when I opened the case, denoted by blinking green light (looks cool).6. On pairing mode the ring of light alternates in green and blue light, the pairing is easy and hassle free.7. The sound after connecting is something I wouldn't say as balanced but on the bass heavy side, but Boat sure knows to make bass heavy earpieces.8. As happened with my earlier Boat wired earpieces, the default eartips/buds had to be replaced with the largest of the extra tips provided in the box and like my previous experience, the sound quality changed and became more balanced although it was still bass heavy and if one can corre tly set equalizer values, the sound may sound better. It is my personal viewpoint and observations.9. The touch may seem to be confusing as the number of tap one has to make and I found that I made more taps than what I should have reuired to do for changing to next track and thus was annoying. However, I believe to be adapted to it after more use. However, having said that, I felt that the after-tap response is a miniscule bit late thereby creating the confusion of tapping.10. There is no volume control option in the earpiece but I found a novel way to do so by pairing both these airdopes and Honor band 5 (with a music control update) with my mobile phone. It worked and still works like magic and guess it is more cool to do so by changing, pausing, controlling volume by a smart band rather than tapping on the airdopes.11. Tested call in outdoors and indoors- in home and in a moving car with other people present. In quieter environment the call is clearer. Having said that for both the cases, the call was quite good even if not HD quality. Still haven't used in a street call. Will update the call quality after another few days of usage.12. The ring of light across the touch area is a dope. I really liked it amd was one of the reason in buying this airdopes, but sadly, I found that they were not lighting up when the song plays and lights up only when certain functions happen. Green for charged condition and searching, Blue-green alternate for pairing and red when tapped on the earpiece. I don't know whether that feature can be turned off or not in these airdopes.13. The battery of the airdopes stood out to 50% after 3 hours of continuous music usage. The battery indicator light on the case has four dots and after 5 hours, 3 dots were visible, thus I conclude that there will be ample juice left for the whole day for a heavy usage.WILL UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER ONE WEEK USAGE."
"At price of ₹2499/- this is the best earbuds, I'd say as this has touch sensor and good quality ear in speakers, it is light weight, but I've given 1star because- it has IPX6 and I brought it by watching advt stating IPX7, 1star for misleading information"
"After getting connected to the device there was some noise constantly coming from left earbud. Right one was fine no issue from this piece. And now I just have to return it, cant even replace it as they are out of stock."
"I purchased these  primarily for office calls on Slack, MS Teams, but unfortunately the mics perform very poorly. Often heard complaint from colleagues that they can't hear me.Telephone calls and WhatsApp calls work fine.Audio outputs are mediocre.Tested with Bohemian rhapsody, average output.I tried this while playing CS:GO , it was only good for listening, other gamers can't hear me, and whenever I pressed the configured  key for speaking, I could hear a weird disturbance with my own voice reflecting.Regarding compatibility, these headphones just don't pair with Windows laptops, Only with Mac and Linux OS bases systems.I tried with 3 different windows 10 OS based laptops, just doesn't connect.All mobiles pair up just fine.So all in all, won't recommend this to anyone.Especially if someone is looking for a wireless headset for office meeting calls.And definitely not for GAMING, wired headsets just do the job."
One the earbuds stopped working after few weeks. Went to Service Center to get it repaired/replaced. Got to know that the Service Center in Noida is running a fraud in which they ask me 500 rupees to replace the product which shouldn't be the case legally. And then made me wait a month to give me back the same faulty product that I gave them.Really disappointed in the Customer Support of Boat. Have mailed them but honestly would think twice before buying boat products in future. Heard from lots of Noida that they faced same fraud and boat is simply doing nothing to save their user base in the city.
"These are some good truly wireless earphones in the market right now that don't burn a hole in your pockets. Fits snuggly in your ear ( but won't remain there for long if you do a rigorous exercise), good noise cancellation, great audio quality, reliable connection up to 6-8 metres and the flickering LEDs are some good points I can think right now. The battery life is good and lasts about 3-4 hours on a single charge. The total times the buds can be charged from the case is good too and practically you won't be able to keep track on the count. It will last easily for weeks. The power bank functionality of the case comes in handy. That's a good feature.So far good. The call quality over the Bluetooth is pretty bad. Yes, bad. Most of the time you won't be able to hear the other person and he wouldn't be able to hear you completely. These buds as headsets perform really poor. So not recommended for that purpose. The buds otherwise are great. Go for it!"
"Even though Iam a regular buyer through Amazon, I very rarely use to write review. Use to post only if iam very much satisfied with the product or just the oppt. This product.. I must write it. Amazing product.. really awsome. It exceed the expectations. You all know that now a days earbuds are available from the starting price range of 1800 to 30000 around. For this boat airpodes it cost 2400/-. So I was expecting just average sound quality and features. But it just brow me away with its punching bass and features. It mentioned only 6mm driver unit in it. It really makes me wonder how a 6mm driver can give such an amazing sound quality with literary ear drum vibrating bass effect. Oh God. Totally unexpected. Thanks Boat giving such amazing product in such an affordable price range. This boat company is winning the trust and love of many customers. Im sure within max of 10 years span, Boat company is going to become a very establish brand."

 Right side dope has no audio at all. It doesnt show green colour light at all no matter how many times connected and disconnected.So returning this item as I have seen reviews that this issue is been faced by many folks that one of the dopes doesnt give audio and replaced items also doesnt work.2 thousand rupees for single airdope?? not worth it...I have followed the manual and done reset, unpair, pair, connect, disconnect in multiple devices, hundred times. Nothing worked.Item got replaced and received a new one..both eardopes are working fine."
"My biggest issue with this, is the comfort!I can't wear it for more than 20-30min without my ears hurting.It creates a sort of vacuum in your ear as well, I guess to enhance sound and as it needs to stay put properly.The sound quality: I cannot complain. It is just wonderful.I can run on the treadmill with the Airdopes in my ears, I can jump around and it won't fall off.Process of connecting is also seamless; auto-connect feature works perfectly (Oneplus 6T)For online classes/meetings: Microphone is just alright. Nothing fancy like Apple Airpods (but again, can you really compare?)Is it value for money? Yes. Very much."
"Pros-Very nice sound.feels like you are in movie hall.touch controls are working perfectly but sometimes normal incidental touch can perform the action.look cool and good, I have Lime colour.the box can also be used as an emergency power bank for your mobile too. (That's a good feature)auto-connects when you open the box.looks rich and people ask you about this.Extra buds and supporters have given.Cons-Not for Calls repeat NOT FOR CALLS.if you are in outer place with the public or in traffic, the other side person on call will hear only traffic and other background noises. I personally feel it. I think the noise cancellation feature is just to write in product description this does not actually work.if you are a music lover then it's for you only but again if it does not fulfill the calling feature then why should we waste so much money? I am going to return it.Please like or rate my review."
"At start I was confused whether to go for this airdopes Or not but after checking multiple reviews on Amazon YouTube & multiple other platform, I circled to go for it. The best thing about this airdope is that you can use it at anytime , under no conditions you will feel that it will be coming out of your ear,The design & bass quality is damn good. Yes after using the airdope for long hours you can feel a little pain due to rubber attached in airdopes but safety is first. So overall for good music, bass & using the airdopes while doing exercise as well this is a go to product."
"Pros:1) Good sound quality2) Decent call quality (as good as can be expected from an ear-pod). Not perfect though so if your requirement is more for calls then consider other options. If requirement is more for songs/movies and few calls then you can go for it.3) Nice charging case4) Durable : My kid dropped it in a glass of water. I immediately took it out and to my surprise it didn't stop workingCons:1) If not put properly, your ear will start aching after few minutes2) Touch button for calling/disconnect so if you adjust the ear pod in the middle of a call, more often than not it will disconnect the call3) There is a slight lag in reaction time which is not a deal breaker as you get used to it."
"The fit for my ears is great and with different sized eartips provided would be so for many others as well .Sound quality is mediocre . Too much bass that distorts and reduces treble and mids .The build quality is below average . The physical aspects , as in the quality of the plastic , moulding , rigidity of the case , all that is above average .However , the battery has issues taht aren't apparent before 6months of use . I bought my pair in Aug 2020 . 5hrs battery life as expected . Come jan/feb of 2021 my left earbud had 3.5 hrs of battery and the right one has 4 hrs . I used them quiet heavily so a battery life depletion wasn't something to complaint about , it was the 0.5 hrs difference that was . Now come june/july 2021 and now I get 3 hrs left and 3.5 hrs right . Now come 22nd Aug , not even a month after my warranty ends and now I'm getting less than 45 mins in my left bud and I don't even bother to use check the right bud because what's the point of a pair of stereo TWS earbuds if I can't use both of them at once ? And the battery life suddenly and dramatically goes down just after warranty period ends ? This is a crystal clear case of planned obsolescence .The box says the MRP is 6000rs , which is way overpriced for a highly mediocre set of earbuds . 1700 is much more reasonable .In short , boat airdopes 441 is a highly mediocre set of earbuds with overpromising and flamboyant marketing that ultimately disappoint .I'd only recommend them if you're planning to use them for 6-7 months"
"I purchased this on the Prime day sale, thinking it would be one of a kind, 'true wireless' earphones with the inbuilt 2600mAH power bank. Well, I stand dissappointed!!Well, if you are looking for a power bank you'll get something better in Rs. 500. You don't need to spend, so much money on a power bank that pretends to be a earphone. Actually, I can't blame boat for this, their marketing was spot on, and not to forget the amount of paid reviews on YouTube were all a catalyst for this buying. Anyway, I'll give you an honest review about my experience with this power bank aka ✌️true wireless ✌️Pros:1. Power bank (2600mAh, you can even charge your phone, only for emergencies), else it gives you around 120 hours of earphones playback time.2. Good ear plugs, and the added fins around it fits perfectly within your ear lobes. Doesn't slip out or cause discomfort.3. Decent bass, and loud.Cons:1. Battery Backup - The problem with this earphones is that the discharge rate way higher than any earphones I've used. Playback /call time is way less than 4.5hrs as claimed by the boat. On a single charge, for calls got around 2hrs and for music playback 2.5hrs. These are individuals stats, but if you're doing both of these activities, you'll get an average of 2hrs.2. Call Quality: Single Pod - Not at all clear and crisp as mentioned by many YouTube and Amazon reviewers. I've always had people telling me from the other end that, they can't hear me clearly or the voice they hear echoes. When you use both the earphones, the voice is a little clear but not to a greater extent. This is not something you would expect from a Rs. 3500 earphones( current rate, I got it for 2500).3. Connectivity : The earphones keeps disconnecting from the phone, and that's when I've my phone in my pocket. At first, I thought probably my phone is behaving weird, but I tried my friend's phone, and it kept disconnecting. It also keeps disconnecting from my laptop as well. So, I see no point why anyone should buy this when the sole purpose of being a true wireless has already been defeated.I rest my case."

 I have paired it with my android phone and MacBook pro. I have been able to switch between devices without many issues.The case has a nice magnetic hold and headphones automatically rest in the box. The box is sleek and small.One feature that is missing is the ability to pause/play videos on macbook using headphone. This was possible using their TruFive.The earphones are highly sensitive to touch and an accidental touch can cut the call.The earphones fit quite well but sometimes they fall off. May not be suitable for running."
"I am prompted to mention about thr sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality. All this will be applicable only if that wretched thing stays on ears..the left one keeps falling if I move my head even a bit. Maybe it's too big to my ears or small. Whatever. I can't return it of course. I have to keep it as a memory of how unreliable online Shopping could be. This was further confirmed by the customer care agent who told me I should not hv bought it from online platform and must hv gone tona shop!!! Pathetic. What a waste of money!!!"
"If you are looking for true bass, then I would not recommend this. While it is good and high on music, it isn't as thumping as mentioned. One of the buds not working is a common problem and restarting/rebooting is the only option to fix it. Fixes perfectly with the ear and ears don't pain even after couple of hours of usage. It does work for 3.5 hours non-stop. No issues with calling.Biggest Drawback: They work pathetically bad with laptops. Right from connectivity to touch sensors to music shuffling (especially on YouTube, everything lags at regular intervals. Bottom line is they are just not made for laptops but if you still want to use it then be prepared to use your hands on keyboard and delayed sound."
"Well for the first time I'm using the term ''disappointed'' for boAt but this time you people have failed to live upto the expectations.I had purchased boAt 441 on 15 June, 2020 which got delivered on 18 June,2020. My overall experience was okayish as the bass quality and the voice quality was pretty decent until today (28 June,2020).My audio device is not working as the person on the other side can not hear a word i say. The whole purpose of buying this headphone is defeated. Considering the work from home scenario I had purchased it to make myself comfortable while attending the 'n' number of calls I get; however, the comfort was short-lived. I hope I get a better replacement for this faulty device."
"I knew I wanted Boats this time but which one? I was so confused buy at the end settled on to this. After reading reviews and everything I was still in doubt but man oh man!These are just perfect! Price is totally reasonable, that too if you get them on sale!(around 1900)• Really good!• Sound is great! Personally I loved it! Perfect bass and treble balance.• My works requires a lot of calling so I was just hoping that they would work. And they work like a charm! Not once I have got a complaint from anyone regarding low audio or background noise and stuff. Too good!• Looks are simply decent and amazing.• Fits perfectly.• Connectivity is superb! Just you open the case and you won't be able to remove the buds and it will get connected!• Battery backup is great! Worked nearly 5-6 hours including regular Calling and songs.If you want to go ahead with a reasonable true wireless piece then don't think anymore. Go with this one. Trust me guys, it's lovely!!!"
"I have used one plus buds Z , and various other buds. The sound quality which these buds give are unmatched. Trust me the Bass is like the best you can experience.The battery charge and charging everything is good.The main thing is you have to change the silicon according to your ear size to get the best effect.Trust me you will go into another world if you hear music or watch a movie. For that reason alone this is the best buy.Forget about the negative reviews. I never had issued with left buds or anything. May be I got a good piece and i am lucky, even if you did Amazon and boat are the best in customer satisfaction. So go Blindly for it. If you get it for 1800 in offer, then these buds are the number one."
I really wish the left earbud didn’t make cracking static noise.Trust me you cant bear it. Its not ignorable. Makes you want to throw the left ear piece.Even the replacement had the same defect. Dont go for the slime color.The red one i ordered before is nice.Sound quality is up to the mark for this price.AGAIN dont compare the sound quality with the wired headphones at this range.These buds give sound quality like the 1000 rs. wired earphones.We are not supposed to expect anything better at this price from any TWS
"I received this earbud on 25 Aug and when I connected to my phone everything was good but when changing the track from my phone/ earbud, there is no sound coming. It automatically losses its sound, then I need to kill the app and reconnect. It's happening with YouTube, Spotify, Gaana, and every other app.Then I replaced this and got today dated 28 Aug but it even worse. The problem is still there and now the left earbud is producing some noise when connected. I did not face this type of issue in any other Bluetooth earphone or earbuds.I even can't replace this also. Totally wasted 2.5k"

 I got it delivered on 14th may. Fully charged it and i am writing this review on 21st may. 1 week later the case still has 2 dots worth of charge. I use the Airdopes daily for calls and music during work hours and while watching YouTube at night. Connection is fast, open the case and it connects to the last device before you even reach out to pick them up. Sound is good if correct ear buds are used. With all that said, it does cause some pain if worn for extended duration specially the rubber flap type thing. I tried replacing it with the smaller flap that comes with it but still causes a little pain. Maybe its just the shape of my ear is weired."
Nice 👍 product and good sound in low budget under 2500₹But it can’t be compared with the sound quality of SONY BOSE SAMSUNG JBL like premium products .....I compared the sound quality With my SONY BLUETOOTH WIRELESS HEADPHONES 🎧 ....in sony the sound quality is awesome 👏 and with details and clearity of every beats even minute or background....but in boat 🚣‍♂️ you can hear 👂 only song......not the background details of music 🎶 track......&One ☝️ more thing this boat 🚤 don’t have noise cancellation function.....some reviewers said that......but No noise cancellation....AndYou can’t connect it to multiple devices
"This is my first time with wireless earphones. I ordered this because the reviews were satisfactory and I was not disappointed.These airdopes have great sound quality. The bass is awesome. I don’t prefer too loud music so it suits my requirement. It’s microphone is fairly good but yes you do have to speak a little louder. The charge doesn’t drop quickly, however I don’t use it all the time, just once a day for 30-45 minutes. It also fits well into my ears.I got it for 1700/- bucks and I am pretty happy with the product."
"Been a premium Amazon Prime customer for several years now... this experience is an absolute unacceptable all time LOW.Box original seal was opened and re sealed with cello tape... very evidently tampered or some used returned product was sent to me. Signs of previous usage and ear wax clear on the product in the images attached. This is totally disgusting and unacceptable by the Amazon retailer. Product didn't work obviously... not surprised that it was previously returned. Bluetooth of the ear buds not identified for pairing... basically overall used and defective product sent to me.Am returning this... hopefully a better review with the replacement ear buds.2 months later review - got the replacement. Sealed and box packed. Within 2 months started facing intermittent issues... abruptly one ear buds would switch off or both shut down within 20 mins of using, even though fully charged. Basically the outcome of cheap and low cost product I guess. My opinion- best to avoid this product model... better go for more reliable ear buds in the 3k to 4k range."
"6-Jul-2021: Quality is okay and as per the price paid so no complaint. But battery is awful. You cannot have 1 hour call on this. During office call, I noticed left bud is out at 45min. Switched to speakerphone on mobile. It happened in another call too. Each time Battery was fully charged before the call and battery is out at 45-50 min with left bud. Boat is marketing battery for 5 hour. That is either flat out lie or poor quality control.Also why rating for this product is so high? Yes rating at Amazon can be manipulated but there seems too many positive rating with this earbud. Maybe I am just unlucky. Will try the replacement.7-Jul-2021: battery time of replacement is 2.5 hour only. One more issue, if you touch your ear during call, call will switch out of bluetooth, you need to select bluetooth options again in call. Same issue with WhatsApp, MS Teams or Zoom call. Poor usability design. On this product return doesn't exist so have to keep it. Not happy for wasting over 2K on this."
I got it delivered yesterday.  Everything is good. But my left ear bud is having a technical glitch type sound while playing any music and it is very disturbing to the ears. But I have full faith on Amazon. I have requested for a replacement.  I have full faith that in my next delivery the problem will be fixed.It was a technical problem. Just a faulty piece maybe. Other than that the product is really good. Took just an hour to full charge when taken out from the box first.
"I bought the neon yellow pair last year in the Amazon Diwali sale. After reading reviews, I decided on the AirDopes Pro because of the extra battery life. I primarily wanted to use them for the gym, for HIIT and heavy cardio and also for watching videos and movies on my phone.I am writing this after almost a year of using them. Overall, I am very disappointed with the defects in the product that have developed over a year and poor customer service.ISSUESBattery Life - AS LISTED, works for way more than the time listed. The case once charged lasted me for around 3-4 weeks, based on a minimum usage of 1-2 hours daily, some days even 4-5 hours.Comfort - they are a comfortable fit, no headaches or any pain in the ear after a year of using them.Touch controls - touch is tricky; in my right bud, the touch works sometimes and sometimes not. Sometimes the bud will turn off without any touch and at other times, repeated touch with the flashing light won't make it change the song. So this aspect is difficult to judge.Sound quality - I listen to EDM in the gym and slow music at other times. Bass is non-existent. the sound quality is nothing to brag about, it is pretty much neutral but that is not why you bought this so do not expect that from these buds.Working - you can use one bud at a time, and leave the other one in the case to charge (to prolong battery life if you are running low or if you only want to listen from one ear). but you will loose the touch controls of whichever bud you are not using (right - track forward, left - track reverse; can be switched off with either).Call - you CANNOT TAKE A CALL on these. they do not work for that, do not buy if you WFH and need these for a call, you will be disappointed and you cannot return them.OTHER CONS- when i got these, there was some background noise in the left bud which would not go away. even after activating my warranty, the company (amazon and boat both) refused to exchange or return these. after some time, the noise went away but i was disappointed at the absence of help through amazon, whose customer service is really good at other times. BE CAREFUL THAT YOU CANNOT RETURN THESE, AND THEY WONT LET YOU EXCHANGE THEM EITHER. the left bud noise issue is present with other reviewers also (I checked later) and remains unsolved and random.- I lost one of my buds two months ago, and there is no way to find it back. No separate application is available for this so just be careful.- the sound quality of my right bud has deteriorated over the past few months (since June, around 10 months after i bought these), and the sound is now so low that I cannot even hear them properly. I regularly clean it and the case, and charge it on time but this issue has not gone away. BE CAREFUL THAT YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE DETIRIORATION OF SOUND QUALITY IN A LESS THAN A YEAR. My brother got the same set in a different colour, and BOTH HIS BUDS have experienced the same sound quality deterioration so this issue is not just limited to my buds.OVERALL - if you can afford a better set of buds, save your money and buy that. There is no point in spending around 3-4k on this only to do that again next year. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
"Very poor quality product -1. While using for calls, you sound very hollow to the person in the other side. I’ve been told I sounded like I was in a tunnel !2. Sound quality is poor - too much treble and that is hard on your ears when conversations are dominant - that’s normally the case with calls.3. The touch system is total BS - if you touch to adjust position during a call , the call gets cut. If you decide to take it off since it doesn’t work well, the call gets cut. The touch is ultra sensitive and you can’t bring your fingers close to the buds without doing something unintended. Horrible design- far from consumer centric.Otherwise, it is fine - pairs easily. Holds charge (esp since it is sparingly used )."
"I got these airdopes during the sale offer. And in less than 2 weeks started facing issues...1. The bass is overly bassy! You can't listen to anything else but thumping bass... No mids or highs whatsoever2. The left earphone was sounding weaker than the right one, I checked all settings and even changed devices to understand if I'm doing something wrong, but it still was the same3. The charging case has a mind of its own! I used to use the earphones twice a day, early morning run and late morning gymming... The other times the pods will sit in the case. Now the case would loose it's own charge within a day in just 3 hours of total usage!I have sent the airdopes back for warranty, but haven't heard back on any status updates. When I called to check on the given phone number, the agent was super clueless! His only response was ""someone from our side will contact you when we're done, give us 15 days"" 🤦🏽‍♂️It was a mistake buying these, save some cash and but something more reliable"
"Battery does not last as long as the company claim. Phone gets connected very often as you try to adjust the headphone in ears while putting it on.Also, very often only one side ear phone gets connected and its a struggle to connect the otherone.Overall, NOT worth the money they charge for it. I had to return to wired headphones than using this one for the non-stop office alls. This is not a convenient one!"
"I'm giving this review after using this Airdopes for 6months. It's nice while using and comfortable wearing whether you're in gym or out.Not good for talking you can't talk over the phone while using this Boat Airdopes 441 pro , person won't be able to hear your voice properly with it. So not good for talking.But after 6 months it stopped working even not connecting to my phone as it used to get connected. So I raised complaint to claim warranty but  Boat provides pathetic services I could say😡, first Boat customer care doesn't reply to your call and mails, I had to do a lot to connect with them. After that they provided me too far service centre's addresses to visit to claim my warranty. Somehow I myself searched nearest Boat service centre and went their they asked me to submit my Airdopes with the problems I mentioned. Boat Team told me that I'll get replacement of this Airdopes under their policy, which will be couriered to me shortly.But after couple of days they sent me the same Airdopes with the problems I was facing at my address. Which is highly disappointing!!I again mailed them about this incident and it took almost about one month just to get the warranty claim after my continuous efforts otherwise Boat would not have given me the warranty.My question is why Boat doesn't provide smooth services and if Boat has one year warranty for their headphones you're supposed to give customers hassle free and good services because it's not our fault that your Airdopes doesn't work after 3-4 months of uses or stops working😡"
"For the price, these earphones make a great choice for anybody on the market for TWS. I've known boat for pretty good sound quality (consumer grade) and really punchy bass, and this offers that very well. The battery backup is decent, and these look pretty good too, and sit almost flush with the ear. No protrusion whatsoever. The fit is amazing, and they just don't come off no matter how much I try to shake them off.Definitely would recommend this in the given price range"
"I ordered a pair of Airdopes in blue colour to match my phone and laptop and they arrived in a proper sealed package and in less than 24 hours at my doorstep. It comes with an instruction manual on how the touch feature works etc. The quality of sound is pretty good as well and I mostly got it for my gymming and gaming so that I do not have to worry about any wires. It's also useful for people who are listening to audio books or college lectures so that they can keep the phone at a distance and do their work by listening side by side. The waterproof feature means your sweat or rain will not affect the sound quality which is useful esp for sports purposes. The light up feature is great for locating the Airdopes in the dark which was useful for my gaming. And I'm able to listen wireless with hands free convinience. The range of the bluetooth connection is really good too! It also came with a charging case and a USB cable for charging. This product is probably the best purchase I have made so far and I'm really happy with it!.Few ways the product can be improved: Many a times when I pair it to a different device, only one of the earplugs work. And the other one doesnt. So I have to put it back into the charger again and then again take it out. I would suggest that there should be a button only for mono mode to prevent it from randomly connecting to only one earplug. But thats just a suggestion I have. Also the USB cord is really small. I think it should be a little bit longer, but I can connect my type C phone cord too it as well. Rest I am happy with my purchase. Thank you :]"
Worst product..After working 3 months the right side capacitive touch doesn't working..even i can't turn off the right side bud...it's so disappointing.. Edit..-they replaced my product with the new one..and til date it’s working fine.although they gave me a diff. Colour. But there customer service is very helpful  I guess my previous product was faulty..this is great..i even droped it in bucket full of water ..still its working as smooth as new one..
"Choosing boAt Airdopes 441 over another brand came down to affordability, and durability. Sure there are much more expensive, and cheaper earbuds, but being spoilt for choice, the boAt Airdopes 441 met my needs. Many prospective buyers who are curious about the origins of the boAt brand? The boAt Airdopes is an Indian consumer electronics brand company who manufacture a fantastic product. For some readers, this review could be long, please bear with me.The reason I bought these earbuds was primarily for hands-free phone conversations with family and friends - giving me the freedom to move away from the handset. The distance of 10 meters mentioned on the instruction manual should be sufficient for most users, provided there are no physical barriers such as walls, doors, and other interference between the Bluetooth signal and the handset. For me, the boat 441 earbuds performed well up to a distance of about 6 meters. But, because of walls between the earbuds and the handset, the calls dropped, and then reconnected once I moved closer to the handset. Without obstructions, the Bluetooth signal should travel the distance of 10 meters comfortably as mentioned in the instruction manual.The instructions in the manual are straightforward and easy to follow. The boAt Airdopes 441 can be used individually, or together for TWS (True Wireless Stereo) listening - perfect for my needs. And besides, if the need arose the earbuds can be factory reset due to malfunctioning, not paring with the handset, or in general, problems with connectivity. The 70-hour (2 hours short of 3 days), standby for the earbuds when in its cradle lets you take it with you when on the move – excellent.What about sound? Well, the 6mm drivers on the earbuds are excellent. There’s lot of bass for bass-heads out there. Considering, prior to buying the earbuds, I rarely listened to music on the handset; now the earbuds are getting a workout. A word of advice - the sound quality could get addictive.The short charging time is excellent for the casual user like myself. I did drain the charging case unknowingly, and when I plugged the case back in, I noticed a mauve / red circle around the blue pulsating light to inform me the charging case is completely, or close to being drained of its charge. Once it begins to charge, the mauve / red circle disappears, while the blue light continues to pulsate. And when the case and the earbuds are fully charged, the pulsating blue light returns to a steady blue. The only downside to the charging experience was the rather short charging cord.The other nice attribute about the boAt 441 Airdopes are they connect using IWP (Insta Wake N’ Pair) technology with your handset. That’s after the earbuds have been paired with the handset. The touch controls are sensitive to either end, or begin a call, or music track. The one option the earbuds don’t have is volume control; it’s got to be done on the handset.I’ve had the boAt 441 Airdopes now for over a month, had a couple of hiccups, which were eventually ironed out. With proper care and handling, hope to get descent miles in the coming years. Incidentally, if you don’t hear any sound in your earbuds? Check if they are paired correctly with the handset, and powered up – fully charged.Lastly, the boAt 441 Airdopes is an excellent pair of earbuds, which deserves 5 stars!Hope this review was helpful."
Let me start the review by pros of the product:1. Light weight2. Sleek looking3. Excellent bluetooth connectivity4. Good sound quality5. Easy to use touch function6. Value for money7. Good for calling8. Connectivity good till 15m or so .....even if u have a wall in between.9. Excellent battery backup. I used it for 3.5h straight with one charge.10. Amazing fit and design.Specially for ppl with small ears....like me!Cons:1. Volume is not very high2. Touch pad is overly sensitive make it's use irritating sometimes3. I use spotify for music. Even If i close spotify app in my phone properly...accidental touch on the airdopes starts the music again. You will have to close the bluetooth itself to avoid that from happening. It becomes quite irritating at times. Now if u switch off bluetooth again and again....then you might have to pair the airdopes again too since one of the airdopes looses connectivity.4. While calling u will experience a disturbance on and off.....u might have to disconnect and connect again to avoid that.Overall it is a very good buy if u get it for around 2k
"The Sound Quality is the best, Even the noise cancellation is amazing and battery life is really HUGE, it comes with 6mm sound drivers which is really good, the waterproofing is the best, I had wore them and gone for a swim, you could hear the sound we'll in the water also, the earbuds are very light and stylish, the charging box comes with 2600mAh, and the best part is you can use the charging case as a power bank also, if you're phones dies then you could charge it, it's really handy for travellers and people who travel frequently, it also comes with 1 year warranty and even the pricing is less (2.5k when I had bought them), it's definitely worth the money, Overall, it's the best TWS earbuds ever. If you're thinking of buying it, Don't hesitate, just go and order it straight away."
"Excellent for the price. Extremely easy to pair. No problem with the sound quality. It works well on calls as well. I would say it works as well as Apple AirPods. I was extremely apprehensive about this product after reading the problems about the noise in the left ear but there is none,  no connectivity issue with the Bluetooth. Those who wrote about it must have got a defective piece. The most important thing to do is to choose the correct size of the rubber bud which goes into the ear. I am extremely happy with it..."
"Alright, I have been using this product for a month now and I have to say the buy was worth it.• Boat lived up to its name and delivered a marvellous sound quality: (4/5). To give you a better idea, let me give you an example: I am able to hear the harmonics and adlibs of every song I listen to just as clearly as the main vocals. It's thAt clear.• As for the bass: (3.5/5), yup, it's good, although if you're someone who listens to metal music would not find it satisfactory. Other than than, the bass is awesome for the other music genres.• Noise cancellation: (3/5), I'm not saying it'll shut you off from the world BUT I'm also nOt saying Airdopes' noise cancellation will be unable to filter the background disturbances. It can. And it does it well. I was satisfied with the NC'n for a product bought at this price range.• The touch controls work wonderfully. They're easy to understand. To be able to control your media with touch rather than having to search for and push buttons happened to be a primitive job well designed and I am hence very happy with the easy controls.Overall this product is very satisfactory for this price. While you can't expect to have the quality of a premium model such as Bose, you sure can expect it to be the toughest competition in the mid range models.My only complaint with Airdopes is that I can't alter the volume as there is simply no option for it. But given that I most have my phone in my pocket I don't think this little problem is not much to not buy this product.So if you're thinking of buying it, go for it."
"Go for this product , it won’t disappoint you !!An excellent productIf you are into running thn trust me you can buy them without giving any second thought. I run 5-7 kms daily and I was seriously searching for an economical solution because I never wanted to invest bulk amount into apple products.So when I came across this product during prime days sale I decided to take a chance .First of all I would like to place my sincere thanks to amazon for before time delivery of the product in an excellent condition.Now coming to the product- Sound Quality is good enough to give to crystal clear beats , Ofcourse in this price range you can’t expect thm to deliver BOSE sounds but still better thn rest .- Grip wise they are just simply best .. I never worry about it , you don’t feel that they’ll fall out .- Good battery life and very compact design- to be honest , I’m this product Noise cancellation doesn’t exist at all , so while running into traffic area you have to extra careful- call quality is high average, I felt it remain better if you don’t move while talking .Over all I must say that it’s an excellent product in this price range .I am a routine user like you guys ( not the paid one) so believe you me , I won’t suggest you anything for personal gains .Go for it , it won’t disappoint you !!"
"The sound quality is nice. Quick Bluetooth connectivity. Handy and compact in size ... easy for travelers, bikers to maintain while driving.. Definitely shock and water-resistant. Bass quality is soo nice. Noise cancellation is good. Touch sensitivity is good. Doesn't discharge quickly and no need to charge for hours. Price is ok for this amazing product"
"Sound clarity 8/10Noise Cancellation 9/10Comfort 8/10Connectivity 5/10Overall, I would want to continue with these but it keeps disconnecting automatically and refuse to pair again. Only one bud pairs sometimes other ones one a social distancing."
"Good for occasional music listeners, but has severe limitations. Specially if you’re an iOS or Mac user, not at all recommended. These days everyone uses 2 devices, but it only connects one device at a time and even if you disconnect one and try to connect 2nd one, it prompts you to forget and repair the 2nd device. And when you go back to the first device, same thing happens. Not at all great experience if you’re using 2 devices. On positive note, battery back up and Bluetooth connectivity is great. Sound quality when it comes to output is above avg, but when it comes to phone calls or attending meetings over zoom, you don’t have good experience.Bottom line is One Should only buy this if they have single device and need the earbud only to listen to music!"
"Buzzing sound from thr left ear bud consistently. Tried with both iPhone & android device, issue persist on both the devices.Need replacement, but boat customer care number +912249461882 is busy all the time, some issue with the line.And Amazon customer care representative are unable to replace it.Can this product be replaced to avoid extra charges, as this was brought during offer period for 2.5k only. Pls advise."
"I liked the look of it, how it is made, the box , lights everything looks very nice and cool. Unfortunately headphones are not meant be a showpiece. It should produce nice sound for the money you pay. This is where this product failes miserably.  Horrible sound quality, I could not believe 2.5k worth gear will sound so horrible, so exchanged it for new one. Again sound remained same. If your goal is to look nice by wearing these, then definitely you should buy this.If you are looking decent sound quality stay miles away from it. All those reviews on YouTube and amazon they may not what is better sounding headphone. JBL, Marshall are benchmark at this price range. It will be grave sin on my part to compare this headphone with that of JBL / Marshall. 300rs Philips neckband headphone sounds  way better than this (Philips neckband headphone is extremely good at that price)"
"Pros:1. At this price point, its much better than the competition.2. The only ear buds with a small silicone/rubber wing. It helps in keeping the bud in place even during work outs. The only time it pops out is if you bend down.3. The fit and finish of the buds and the storage case is decent. Size+ weight of the buds is perfect. The box is also small enough to be carried in your pocket.4. Very bass heavy sound stage. For most indian users, this will be a good thing.Cons:1. IWP sometimes fails. Just pop ear buds back in box and close. Open and try again.2. Touch control on the buds also sometimes fails. But again a simple reset solves the problem. (Ive noticed the failure only when my phone is connected to my amazfit watch also. And my watch also has music control, i suspect that could be the reason).3. The noise cancellation is purely by virtue of the snug fit of the ear buds. Similar to a passive noise cancellation.4. The microphone is decent, but picks up a lot of ambient noise. So a call in a public place will be a problem for the person you talk to.(multiple callers i spoke to mentioned too much background voices etc).5. Finally the sound stage/profile being too bass centric. Most songs can get by, but sometimes the bass just over powers everything else. Some tweaking of the equaliser may help.Verdict: would recommmend it for casual music listening. And for people who need music while they exercise. At this price point, im happy with my purchase."
This product is not worth a penny. I have been using it and it is not good in any aspect. I have purchased a 50 rs wired earphones and they work better than this. In the name of noise cancellation it will cancel your own voice but it will definitely amplify your background noise. The person who you are calling won't be able to hear u clearly. You'll end up holding one earbud near your mouth for them to be able to hear you.Now talking about music. Literally every other earbud will give you same voice. Don't fall for thumping bass marketing. Invest your money somewhere else.Also one more thing to note. It really slips from ears fast.
"First thing i wanna say ""just buy this""This is a riview after 10 days and seriously these tws are the best under 3k.Connectivity: Its too fast i mean the moment you will open the case it will automatically connect to the last connected deviceRange: Its fine.. if you leave your phone in your bedroom and went to another room or balcony it will remain connected without any problemBattery life: Best battery backup man for sure i hear it at 60 to 70 volume and the buds are streaming music for 4.5 to 5 hours which is hell lot.. And talking about the case i didn't charger it till now .. will update youSound quality and bass: Sound quality is above my expectations (for a tws under 3k) i mean its well balanced you can surely hear vocals well until you play GOOBA extreme bass boosted xD.  Bass is too very punchy but balanced and you can surely feel the vibrations in your ear😉. *note: many people are complaining about a static noice coming but there is no such thing in my case*Touch: Its very responsive and simple.These earphone are super steady in ears i am a basketball player and have to use this thing for workouts and there is no problem for falling of buds or because of sweatVerdict : buy this if you are buying it for 2.5k or 3k but dont buy it for 7k"
"If you are a bass lover then go  for it, bass is not overwhelming but punchy and maintain highs and mids properly with bass on higher side and thats how I like it.Noise cancellation is superb but this great ability restricts you from wearing them while walking on roads.Looks great, fit is a subjective isssue which can be adjusted and one you get the best fit you will make the most out of this TWS.Battery is one of the most impressing things of this device which lasts around 1 week if you are using it for 4 hours a day. Boat airdopes 441 pro is not worth as that one is quite bulky and too much of battery backup is just of no use as this one is providing more than enough.Charging case is sturdy feels premium in hands and small enough to be unnoticable when you carry the aroundCall experince was nice good when environment is quiet but in noisy conditions it works just fine for other side to be able to hear but can hear the noises too.There is absolutely no connectivity issue with them and comes with touch control with very good response and gestures provided on them.You can get them around ₹2000 in any electronics sale which make it worth for money 💰.If you have a budget around 2k then these are best for you. If there is any reason I will not recommended them is if you have better budget or you want superior call quality.Rest if you are looking to have a complete tws with spending less and saving more there is no reason you should spend more."
"Bumblebee Yellow: If you are using it while riding, then use only one, because you cannot hear, as it is almost 90% noise cancellation.Pros:1. The finishing given to the earphones are neat, which gives it a premium look.2. Clear sound while talking on the phone and listening to music3. Good low bass.4. LED indicators for the battery %5. True wireless tech is amazing,6. Fits perfectly in the ear (if the right earbuds are used)7. Provided extra buds for ear adjustments – make sure you have the right fitting or else it keeps falling off8. Lightweight and easy to carry about9. Feather touch10. 9 meters/ 29 feet radius beyond which it disconnects/ audio starts cracking.11. Cannot comment on the battery life, I just got it. (received the earphones with 100% battery)12. C type charging port which is easily available to charge.13. The wire used for charging is a flat type.Cons:1. Very sensitive touch2. Cannot control the volume on the earpiece, need your phone to control the volume.3. When there is nothing playing (no music or call) there is a faint static sound that is heard at times4. There is no power adapter only a wireGood delivery by Appario and good packaging by Amazon."
"Good product  . Bought it on sale , the cost was around 1999 . First thing I noticed was the weight , it was totally weightless . Second was the sound quality , it was better than what I had expected for a sub 2k earphones . Third was the ease of use , was very easy to pair and use  . The touch sensitivity is excellent  and can be worn even when for my morning run  . The best aspect is the battery life . Worth every paisa"
"It is really a great product I got it for ₹1999 on sale. The bass effect is amazing and battery back up is just superb.Cons :Main drawback  is the touch is very sensitive so even a slight touch of your hand while adjusting the bud in your ear would cause the music to stop.CAN’T  use this while you are sleeping or laying side ways on your pillow - if you are person who listens to music while you sleep then you are in for a nightmare . You simply can’t use this as the touch to the pillow just turns off your earphones.Touch doesn’t just work with your hands it works with any dress material , gloves , pillows .... you name any surface it will be able to operate your earphones"
"I have been using this from last 3 months and here is my opinion:Pros-1. Fits perfectly in ears with or without the ear hook.2. Bass quality is very good as per my experience.3. Boat claims 25 hours of total playback and yes they are right because I got a battery backup of total 22 to 23 hours with the case at average or medium volume and almost 17 to 18 hours of total backup at full volume.4. I found the noise cancelation very good especially in this price range.5. You get 2 years warranty with the product which no other company provides you in this price range.6. Easy to hold the case in hand, very sleek design.Cons-1. If you are using it for long sessions with or without the ear hook your ears may start paining because i have experienced it as they pain very much if you remove them after 2 or 3 hrs using.2. Plastic body case which might disappoint you.Overall a good product specially in 2k with good audio quality, bass, noise cancelation, fitting, etc. If you want a TWS in this price range from a trust worthy brand go for it.👍"
"boAt Airdopes 441 comes with the latest Bluetooth v5 and gives you a truly wireless experience.It is equipped with IWP (Insta Wake N’ Pair) Technology that powers on the earbuds and puts them into connection mode as soon as one opens the lid of the carry case.Each earbud offers up to 5 hours of sound in a single chargeAlso, the charging case provides an additional 25 hours of playback audio.airdopes 441 has 6mm Drivers for fascinating audio bliss with HD sound.IPX6 rated protection against water and sweat to provide a carefree listening experience.The stereo calling feature makes your calling experience clear and smooth.boAt airdopes 441 offers one-tap instant voice assistant  to control and access the earbudsIt is specially designed to meet the needs of every music lover and offers extraordinary style with sports-centric, secure-fit ear hooks; although it might feel itchy from time to time. Should make a note of that BEFORE YOUR DECIDE TO BUY!"
"Pros:-Brilliant packaging-Damn impressive Led lights on Earbuds making them very attractive-Flawless connectivity with no apparent master-servant earbud visibility, therefore I can easily use one earbud at a time without losing connectivity.-Decent bass, nothing too overpowering.Cons-unlike old boat earphones I have (wired 225) these didn't have two sets of earbuds, which is all the more important because tws have special kind of buds which are hard to find. Plus, unlike them, this did not have a resealable packet, therefore once you open it, you gotta keep it somewhere else.- horrible lag for a bluetooth 5 earphone. Almost 1+ second lag. Moreover, it has a visible .5 second delay sometimes even for movies on netflix which generally sync the audio delay on bluetooth devices to make up for delayed lag. I'm not sure why it's there but it is.- though we all knew the calling wouldn't be clear in a tws, I tried using one piece near my mouth for easier clarity, but the super sensitive taps end up cutting the call instead, I wish we had an option to disable one tap cutting call on tws.- person issue- i find the connecting sound to be rather spookyDespite the nitpicking cons, I really like it. Though these aren't for gaming or calls, and definitely not to be worn while wearing a mask supported behind ear, because it'll hurt a lit otherwise."
"I had boat rockerz 510 ON EAR headphones & that gave me the impression that these particular Boat Airdope 441 may be  good but Honestly it doesnt. First, the airdope's Ear bud are kind of circular Cone shaped & that itself pushes out the Airdope away from ear & hence falls out easily! Second the Boat Earfins ie on side a small projected guard kind to prevent from fallout, that also doesnt seem to serve purpose! Inside 2 Airfins- Long Airfin, SHort Airfin provided. The problem is Long Airfin is a pain on the ears, neither provided grip & then short Airfin is kind of too small & dont serve either. PERHAPS THE DESIGN IS NOT MADE FOR ALL EARS, IN MY CASE IF I DO A LITTLE BIT OF JUMPING OR EXERCISE THE AIRDOPES FELL OUT EASILY SO WHATS THE USE?? Secondly The SOUND QUALITY is below Average, The BASE is OVER AMPLIFIED and the TREBBLE/Voices are not crystal clear enough and in High Volume you will only hear BASE and voice in music will be negligible. So it didnt leave upto the expectation. And Voice call is mostly unheard on the otherside. I would say the product is or may be good for NEW CUSTOMERS who just recently bought a wireless piece for the First Time but its not good for Experience customers like those who had Boat Rockers 510 as these 510 has awesome bass and awesome voice clarity in music, only downfall is bulky & not fit for voice call"
"I purchased these airdopes in October 2020....I don't usually review any purchased items. But these airdopes are like Gopi bahu(and Aquaman)....no matter how bad they've been treated...they work just fine.So I am here.. writing a review after 7 months. Although I like earphones from the time of purchase itself,the connectivity, 8d kind of audio quality, etcBut recently I mistakenly dropped one of the airdope(Aquaman) in water and it stayed there immersed for 3 days .....on the fourth day when I found it .....I was sure it wouldn't work ...but by the time I splashed water on in....the LED started blinking red🙂......i thought to myself....that it's just the LED.....then it got connected with my phone..flawlessly....played music... flawlessly.....I was amazed. Only recently I found that the speaker is not working while I am on a call. I am totally fine with it.Now comes the miraculous escape of the other airdope....I ""accidentally""( I am very careful most of the times 🙂).....put the other airdope on top of the mixer grinder....the place where the jar fixes with the body(who does that?... I did)....and my equally carefully mom carefully fixed the jar with airdope beneath it. Next comes the sound of stones being ground.....but the jar had peanuts inside....that is when it hit me.I rushed and removed the jar. There it was.... innocently blinking red at me...I saw Gopi vaww in that moment. This time too I was sure that It wouldn't work , so I threw it in a shelf. But...you guessed it right....after 4 days today...when I finally freed myself from the claws of idling...I tried pairing it and IT IS WORKING TOTALLY FINE, without any issues whatsoever. Seriously, why?? Why tolerate so much?Hope my short review would pursuade you enough that you start dreaming about it....until you finally decide to buy it."
boAt Airdopes 441 has no good noise cancellation difficult to hear from other side. Bass level is poor. Battery dains out to 20% just in 10 minutes calls. Buying this  boAt Airdopes 441 is waste of money. I don't recommend to buy boAt Airdopes 441.
"Frankly speaking Boat's products are attractive in the first go, but once yiu use it, you'll come to know that you have wasted your money purchasing its products.I'm a school teacher, so have to take online classes, so I am bound it very often...to cut short, after purchasing this product, within 6months I had to claim for a replacement, they even replaced it with a new one, obviously with a different colour, which will irritate you. Then again this product is horrible. Now I'm having so many problems like heating issue, very poor battery back-up of not more than 40 minutes, poor connection....anf what not...so will you choose a product which is not going to survive for 6months.....finally I'm abot to order a new one of different obviously...and will never ever go for BOAT products, or will suggest anyone...."
"Hey there!So, I just received my pair of Boat Airdopes 441 and as you can see in the pictures, it is in yellow and it's perfectly splendid! 😁I like the design a lot. The fit is snug and comfortable to my ears (two pairs of extra eartips are provided, so use what fits you). The average size tips fit me well and the fins help to secure it in your ears. It doesn't fall off even when working out. I need to check it with jump rope though.The bass is punchy and the various sounds are clear to my ears at medium volume.There is a kind of passive noise cancellation due to the in-ear design and it works a bit.Don't know about the battery life. Later, I might give an edit to this section after using it.The only thing I found a bit odd was that whenever I press pause/play, the music does not stop instantly. It takes about a second to stop.The packaging by Amazon was good.I got it for a mere ₹1600 and a tws at this price point, it's a steal!I suggest that you go for it! 👍Cheers!"
"Sound quality is good but the feature of noise cancellation works in wrong way. I used it with all types of software, Zoom, GoogleMeet, etc. The noise cancellation features auto disconnects and connects earphones all the time. I cannot connect my earphones when I am in meeting, it just sucks. Tried to search on google and I have applied almost all the workaround by updating zoom, updating Google Meet, checking on option of dont want noise cancellation everything. The problem is with earphones, they keep on connecting and disconnecting again and again.Use it only if you want to listen to music. If you want to join meetings then this product is not worth it."
"After a lot of brain storming, I decided to go with Boat Airdopes 441. At this time, Xiaomi had already launched it's ear buds in 1799 but I still went ahead with Boat Airdopes because I loved the looks and I trust the bass from Boat.Looks - Trendy looking. The additional colorful bands that come up with it adds to the the looks.Sound - It has decent sound and good bassBattery Back up - It easily gives you around 4 hours though the company claims 5 hours. With the charging case, the battery back up doubles up easily.Comfort - I didn't find these buds too comfortable and after using it for 2-3 hours, my ears started hurting. I have to So even after all the decent features, this point alone brings the rating down to 3/5.Summary: Great earbuds but look out for other options in the price range 3000-3500"
"Its a good product, my piece has a little static that is noticeable when nothing is playing, but when the music starts to play the bass takes over and you realize how well made these small piece of earphones are. They are pretty cheap and really worth the money, the battery life could be better but the case makes up for it. The bass is good the treble is a little too much at high volumes but these aren't bose headsets so don't expect studio level sound quality from them.  If you are looking for eveyday headsets that are wireless go for them you can't go wrong with boat. Made in china tho, if that is an issue for you then think is over, but to make you feel better i can only say that they definately don't feel like a made in china product."
"Amazing product. Worth buying. I already had wireless neck band. Still purchased this product. Very happy to have it. Connectivity is the best. Connects quickly without any disturbance on calls.Very comfortable and convenient. You can use one pod at a time while on calls (increases standby time of other pod). Also, it charges on its own. Very Good battery life. The touch sometimes is annoying, as the call drops when you touch the pod by mistake. Otherwise, it is an awesome product for both calls and listing to audio."
"I have been using these since Dec 2020 and I havent found any particular fault in this.Ofcourse when you are buying a product worth 2500, yoir expectations are usually low.But this product has changed everything.The sound is really nice, superb noise cancellation, charges fast and good batter backup.I usually use this for Call of Duty mobile games and trust me its simply awesome. You can hear every minute details from a gaming perspective.Sound is clear and bass is too good.There are hardly any products outside at such a lucrative price.Go for it guys."
"As expected, in this price tag, one should not expect too much of the sound quality, the most important aspect of an audio device. Earbuds are great piece of engineering designed to be short lived, and this sophistication should come at a price. However, an ultra competitive market for these has created a mushroom growth of fancy looking earbuds, with minimal focus of the most important aspect: The Sound. No complaints however, we asked for these. Boats Airdopes 441 is no exception. To summarise my observations, with a bias towards the less said points are as follows:1. The product comes in attractive package. However, don't get swayed by it. If you notice with Sherlockian eye, you soon start finding the issues. The package has silly grammatical errors and style mismatch. For example, look at the bottom most line. What does it say?""This can done using the volume control on your bluetooth device...""A little above you will find ""Charging norms & Precautionary Guidelines"".Now take out the nice little box and turn over. 'Earbuds' battery' but 'Charging Box Battery' (see the image attached).Does it really matter? Yes. It reflects a company's care towards maintaining the brand image (Remember, what happened to Micromax?). It is particularly a shame, because India is a major English speaking country and their tag "" MADE IN INDIA BY AN INDIAN BRAND"" really doesn't go as per with these mistakes which arise from a careless  person who didn't have Grammerly installed in PC. Is it a deal breaker? No.2. Inside the box you will find a bunch of useless papers with photos of 'celebrities' claiming to use Boats and also a sticker for no reason. The charging case, however is attractive and well designed with a USB-C port. The case is not operable with one hand though, you need both.3. After opening, the experience was more or less smooth. Just after opening this Pandora's box, you will notice alternative green and blue lights flashing on the touch control, suggesting they are paired. Pairing is an ease, with little manual effort, particularly with an Android phone. Soon one earbud stops flashing, only one does inside the box, but they remain paired. Don't mistake it as a problem.4. As I said, Boat focused so much into the package and design, they probably forgot the most important thing: the sound quality. The little buddies are bass heavy, which means they will be really bad for instrument separation or high frequency music. As far as my testing goes, for calling and listening to audio stories, they work just okay.5. One good point is however it's waterproofing rating. It is IPX7 rated, unlike most of its competitors, which come with either IP4 or IP5 rating. Now, I haven't tested the waterproofing myself, but for heavy exercise, this works more or less fine. Not perfect, because I have experienced frequent disconnection between two buds, which can be restored by putting them into the case.So that's a list of my observations frequently not discussed. If you are fine with average sound, and with a budget, this can do the job. After all, number of reviews in any platform will tell you that these are extensively tested by a lot of people. And that is not without reasons."
Hii guys!... I am writing a review because i was also reading reviews before buy the airdops... So I am using the airdopes for last 2-3 days. Sound quality is awesome. Battery life is exactly as mentioned in the descriptions. It also shows a battery sign on your phone like this🔋. Delivery is real fast thank to Amazon for that. Calling experience is really good. There is no noise from both the sides during the call. There is no automatically disconnection of calls. Connectivity is the best thing. Airdops connect to your phone as soon as you pick them out of the case after first time pairing process. Charging is really fast. Airdops fits in the ear very smoothly and comfortably.Is prize m yeh ek dm badiya product h yrrr m bhi aap hi k jese review pdh kr liya the inko to socha ki m bhi aane walo ki help kr doon review dekr to is liye kr diya. Love uh and uh can go for it.
The left earphone makes a noise with the start of music. This noise continues for about 7-8 seconds after the music stops.It becomes quite irittating to use the earphones with that noise in the background.Read about same problem with other customers too.
"- Noise cancellation though passive is very good- Optimal bass quality, loudness, pitch (no flaw, in any genre or type of music)- Perfect fit in ear, very less or no pain on prolonged use- Mono-mode suuported i.e. can use just one bud while other's charging (Literally doubles the effective battery life)- Awesome battery life (~48 hours of continuous music at 90% volume on single charge)- Case has decent battery life (~1 week)-  Decent range, can operate across rooms of the house but not on diff floors- Auto Pairing- Microphone : Decent, slightly low output to the other side but merely creates any difference"
"Purchased on 16th October, delivered an e mpty package on 23rd October, from then till now following up with the CC but still didn't get any kind of resolution."
Okay so now let’s talk about the actual product . I have been using this for the past 2 months and here is what has happened. At first the buds where shutting down in IOS (iPhone ) like crazy in every 15 minuteSo i stopped using it on my IOS and used it on my work phone which was android. It was working fine until December start where it started to shut down and reconnect again.Sorry for me this product is pathetic I paid 2700 for this. I feel cheated. Idk it was way worst than that any other local buds I used in the past.
"I'm giving my honest feedback after using Boat Airdopes 441, Boat Airdopes 121 and pTron Bassbuds. If anyone have questions on comparison please ask ans I will try to reply all.Value for Money : Yes.👍 I would say it would be best buy if priced between ₹1600-₹1800.Sound Quality: Very good 👍 The bass and treble sharing is good. Its more on the bass side. Not excellent but not annoying. You will enjoy some good music in these buds.Noise Cancellation: Yes 👍 I should warn you not to use while doing anything that requires your attention. Even if its raining heavily outside you wont hear a thing.Bass Quality : On a scale from 1 to 5 I would give a 4.Audio: Doesn't hurt your eardrums if you maintain volume between 30%-70%. 121model sounds best around 50% while 441model sounds best around 70%.Body: Perfect 👌 The case is hard and lid is tight enough. Its magnetic lid hence its not as tight as a groove. However lid wont open by itself.Battery: Pretty Good battery life. Both on buds and case. Lasts almost 4-6 hours based on usage. U can charge 3 full and a little bit more on both earbuds.Design & Fit : Very sleek design and fits perfectly inside ear. Can't make out that u r wearing it. Use suitable silicon buds. The extra grip included in design keeps the earplug intact. It wont fall even while jogging or dancing.Features : Added features include touch sensitive buttons. U need not press which makes it less annoying bcoz pressing a button when it is stuck deep inside ear is irritating. It includes Water Resistance, you wont get in trouble in slight drizzle or droplets of water/sweat on the button.Calling : I didn't find any problem in calls however I wouldn't suggest this for calling. The other person might hear your voice aa if inside a tunnel. Gradually call quality will decrease, I speculate.Final Opinion ::Its a very good product. I felt price could have been lesser. Fits inside ear perfectly and sound is too good. Battery doesn't drain fastHowever your phone battery might, if continuously connected.The only gripe I have is that due to touch input we may tend to pause audio or open Google Assistance by mistake. Its very sensitive. You cannot wear and sleep because even if it touches your pillow surface audio will stop.I hope this feedback helps you decide better.RegardsVinay Acharya"
"Boat used very good materials, you get earbuds, 1 case, 1 charging cable (no charger), extra ear rubber rings and rubber buds.Dropping don't cause any damage as well as these are waterproof so you can use them any weather.Fit in ears perfectly, even while running or jogging. Connectivity is super quick. You face no errors or anything and if did then simply can reset them in the case. Buy them for 2499 or less or simply buy 441 normal one the only difference is reverse charging with 2600mah battery is available in pro one. Otherwise both are same works 5+hrs easily.Well while calling, you get not much noice cancellation on offer but can make sure that your voice will be clear than bg voice. 3.8/5Sound quality is really good."
"//The case size is compared to my Noise Shots case in the pic//Insta pair works very well but beware the case is very slippery dues to matte plastic as least for me and cannot be opened with one hand at least not easily. The case hinge could have been better but it does feel premium in hand compared to other earbuds in this range. The bass is quite overpowering which I don't like cause it kills the actual music quality unless you like too much base. However on non bassy music it is good not great. You get a Type-C cable in box and 3 extra ear tips and 1 extra ear hook along with usual BoAt promotional stuff. Battery lasts for around 4-5 hrs on an individual bud. Fit my ear perfectly and won't fall off even while jogging. Although keep in mind the touch controls are very sensitive which is good but while removing them out of the case or your ear can accidentally reject calls , pause your content or reset the buds due to triple taps as the buds are small so you are definitely going to have accidental touches a lot. However the recent price drop in the Great Indian sale from 2499 to 1999 felt like a kick in the nuts because I bought them a week before the sale."

"Sound is best,,bass is extreme best..But connectivity is biggest problem,,resetting it again n again its irritating,,After using 3-4days my right bud is not properly charging..and battery low for only right bud withing few minutes of using...so i m replacing it now..Sound 4.5/5Battery 3/5(mine right bud is not properly charging)Built quality 3.5/5Fitting 4/5Connectivity 2.5/5 (some irritating function)Touch 5/5 for sensitivity but its too much ...not needed actully so 4/5Moreover if i get replaced will write again review...EDIT: same problem occured again with the product...i just returned...its my badluck that i got damaged product both times.."
"Please don't buy this airdopes 411pro , because it has a manufacturing defect in left earbud.Which has a static sound .Can't return to Amazon because it has already been 14 days from the date of purchase.I have raised a complaint on boat customer support .Will update after getting replacement if the problem is still there"
"It's good for listening songs and watching movies but worst for calling facility.Noise cancelling is just neglectable.Tried indoor, calling is OK.Tried outdoor, calling is worst.  Other person can't hear your voice other then he can just hear the surrounding sounds.Not recommended for calling.Best for music and movie lovers."
"Looks nice, sound quality is reasonable for music, movies and YouTube, though nothing to write home about. But call function is abysmal, voice trails, echoes and seems muffled. In other words, you CAN NOT MAKE CALLS using this unless you want to annoy the hell out of the person you are calling and in turn, yourself too.This item is non-returnable and understandably so. To their credit, they clearly declare that it is only possible to replace it within 7 day's time. I got this for INR 1999 with discounts."
"Great for all the activites whether for watching YouTube, Social Media, Amazon Prime, Online Lectures it works really great.Everybody has a different preference and thus taking into consideration this thing you may accordingly plan your purchase.I'm a not the active user of social media nor the YouTube, yet I really feel that this Earbuds are great for my usage as I earlier used the Samsung EarPhones which had a really nice sound and this too is the same.I haven't yet turned my media volume to more than 40% still the Audio is loud and clear for me. This also depends on the device you use as every device has it's own hardware capability. Even I use it at 25% volume it feels me not to go beyond this level.The images will make most things clear with respect to its appearance and design and the extra eartips included In the box.Points that you must take into account is:1: Your mobile device hardware capability( not the processor but the audio output )2: Your Usage in aggregate3: Your priority as to battery backup as it has 2600 mAh case. ( This 441 pro has a smaller variant  boAt 441 similar to it priced lower than this which has everything same but, a smaller battery case)4: Futher my order of usage will make it easier to think as if similar matches yours:  Online Classes/ Lectures sometimes live lecture too ; Music Songs ; YouTube ;Hence you must prior to purchase look after this and make a confident purchase.Conclusion:- I was earlier thought to purchase a cheap Chinese brand TWS, but later thought to increase my budget to get Earbuds from an Indian company rather than other chinese brand which merely does any innovation yet charges a considerable high price, leading them to their higher profit margin.boAt is an Indian Brand and this earbuds matched my usage and thus I loved them."
Sound: goodBattery life: Goodoverall good earbuds. I purchase in 1999rs. As i am software engineer i requied to do skype and other calls on my laptop. But when i use for skype calling. there is some problem in mic. other can not able to hear my voice so i need to remove their connection.But watching the movies and other stuff it is perfect for laptop.On mobile: Everything works fine.
It works well. The dock is magnetised so that one can never put the pods in the wrong direction. The voice is loud and clear and the microphone also seems to work fine. Haven't tested it in noisy conditions so cannot vouch for the performance under extreme circumstances. Nevertheless works well when being used while cooking in the kitchen :-).The battery lasts long enough and it appears to stretch further as one tends to put it back in the pod receptacle for the fear of losing it. :-).Nice wireless in the ear pods.
"Let me state the positives firstSound quality is as per what you'd expect in this price range...Now the issue that made me give this a 1 star...Battery life is pathetic..I've always used both the earbud together, never used only one at a time.Within the first week, my right earbud started running out of the battery about 15 minutes before the left one. So the right one will switch off and the left one will go on for about 15 minutes more. I didn't think too much of it and used to put the buds back on charging once the right went out of battery.  BIG MISTAKE I should have returned them in 1st week itself.At this point right one used to last between 3.5 to 4 hours, and left one would last 15 - 20 minutes more if I continued using it.The time right lasted kept on decreasing and the time gap between how long right lasted and left lasted kept on increasing.And now about 8 months later it has come to a point where the right ones do not last more than 30 minutes!!!So I can't use my earbuds for more than 30 mins...I don't know how long the left lasts now if I continue using it because I've completely stopped using my earbuds. What's the point of only being able to use it for 30 minutes, as soon as I start using I just keep wondering when is it gonna say ""battery low""I find these earbuds a complete waste of money"
Review after used for 2 days..Highly Recommended.Sound Quality Awesome.Bass Quality Awesome.Better Noise Cancellation.Really Satisfied with this product.Now my reviews are..Defective product..2 times I have replaced the same due some issues..After multiple replacement.. was facing issuesDo not waste your time and money..Awesome was nice..
"First of all it’s not good for long time usage usually none are except airpods as I have been using them too, other than that for basic hour or two usuage it will do the job overall the quality is good but while taking phone calls quality could have been better otherwise for music it’s good for the price. Just wished this colourful lights that glow all the time while changing songs ( only glows at that time or while taking them out of the case ) makes it look cheap personal opinion."
"Bought it for 1999/-Battry back up is poor, sound quality better.Sometimes one of the earpiece stop functioning.The worst part is that... The battry drainge rate of both the pods are not same. Means.. One down., still other keeps on going. That makes... U feel irritated."
"I would simply say, they are best for their price.I literally searched and watched videos and whatnot for a TON of products like this one, in this range.Reviews were there, but I always was sceptical. But then finally bought them for my sister.And happy to say, they are amazing.Just go for it. Don't waste time looking elsewhere.Note: READ THE MANUAL, even if it is boring. Because at times, you would feel that one earbud has stopped working, but it actually has not. It is a feature that allows only one bud to play. So please read the manual even if it may seem boring.My only deduction of 1 start would be for loudness. When I connect to my laptop, it does not get as loud as I would like it to, even at full volume. Could be my own problem, or maybe not.But for that price, and in that range, these are the best. I have recommended them to 4 people, and 3 of them bought them, and they all are happy so far. It has been 6 months or so."
"1. It is not comfortable to use for long hours. Your ears start paining if you wear for long.2. If the headphones were used by someone earlier, and you re-use them again, it remains connected to their device until it is disconnected from the previously used device. Say if the person is in meeting and you want to use these headphones, you can not use it until it is disconnected from another device.3. The top part of the headphones is highly touch-sensitive. Even when you adjust headphones, it changes the settings as the touch part is to change the setting."
Sound quality is good But not Loud And Bass is ok ok because if you can customise Bass In the Phone setting and It will be give us Normal sound But Bass Bossted sound With 6MM driver. And treable is ok.And Product build Quality is SuperB.And Charging Is fast.But This Airdopes are pain in your ears in the 15-35 in.And amazon does'nt return my product dont buy.with amazon flipkart policy is best.
"NOTE: To be very clear about bluetooth earphone device ( Information )Noise cancelling: This means this helps the wearer drown out ambient noise and focus on talking to someone. Which means it cuts down the noise around you not the person on call, so he will hearing everything.Noise cancelling Microphone: The bluetooth should have this option to cut down the noise around you and make your voice clear to the person you are speaking too.PROS: Good for music lovers, walking jogging etc..CONS: Bad call quality experience as the earphones does not have Noise cancelling microphone option.For this price point its good.Verdict: Incase you need it for calls, music and more Investing more money on bluetooth earphone will give you a great experience including Noise cancelling microphones etc.."
"I have tried the bluetooth based headphones (for cordless application) for the first time. But my experience with airdrops from Boat is excellent. The first thing which I felt good was that these fit in very well in our years due to the special rubber extenders present help fit into any ear without being painful. We can easily jog without fear of it popping out of your ears. The battery back up is very good, and the advantage is that the case retains the battery back up for over two weeks if one is using for one hour a day for exercise (which I use). But I am sure if one uses for 3 to four hours a day then it should surely last for over a week before you charge. It is very easy to charge to both directly from power source or from any power bank or phone. Extremely satisfied with sound quality, ease of stop, forward, reverse and play by tapping on the airdrops. Since they fit in very nicely to ear you need to remove one of them to talk to people."
"Right side ear bud stopped working in 10 days and till that time return policy was also over.To add in the boat service is really worst, they have taken my brand new product and provided me refurbished very old and dirty product. They should provide me either a new pair or by repairing mine one. Any Boat team member reading this, will highly appreciate if you could make this good, rather than more worst.Please do not waste your money.I am writing this review again after suffering for a month... I have still not got my product. In replacement of new 441 pro product they have provided me 441 and there customer care person says, we do not have 441 pro. You will get this only ! I have paid for 441 pro and not able to use it for 10 days. Third class brand and third class brand support."
"So i got this airdopes pro in amazon prime sale for 2500/- Rs. So i got an amazing deal.I am very satisfied with this product.Sound quality:-The sound quality of this product is very decent.  Low frequency ( bass ) is  bossted. But i like it. Depends on you. Mids and highs are also decent.In this price range quality for these airdopes are decent.Noise cancellation:- The outer noisw cancellation for person who is hearing is very good. Example, if you wear these properly  outer noise will reduce and you will hear less noise frok outside.But the noise cancellation during call is very bad.When you call someone the other person will here everything so loudly except your voice. Even little outside noise will feel so loud for that person. So if you're only buying these for calling, it is not a good option.Built Quality:-Built Quality for the headphones and the case both are very good. The case is sturdy and good quality.Also when you wear them in ears they fit properly. They don't fall out during exercise. Also they are waterproof so swet won't be a problem.Overall i find these very helpful and good. I am satisfied with these"
"Worth waiting as I ordered it on 8 August, Freedom sale. What a great earbuds they are.Bass is super in it but sound quality is not up to mark as compared to Boat wired earphones.I can say that its a decent quality of sound. Its Case quality is very good, feels like something premium in your hand. Battery life is also great as it gives you 150 hrs play back tym. Great fit in my ears and my blue colour earbuds looks awesome. As compared to other Brand, no one brand can beat Boat Airdopes 441 pro.I played pubg also by using them and there is no sound lagg which is very impressive. You should definitely buy it. Its a complete package and gives you worth buying at a price of Rs2500. Finally got something after waiting for so long. Overall no brand can beat them and I loved it, I think everyone would love it after using it."
"It has very good battery backup, The sound quality is just amazing, Note that it has slightly boosted baseamazing for base lovers, it has a decent latency, it connects to the phone instantly after opening the case.The build quality is pretty good , it has a pretty snuggy fit, it dosent fall off at all, even outdors.it might hurt your outer years in the begining but later you will get used to it.Overall its a good product at this price"
totally i am upset.because boAt is good company.recently i  have bought  boAt  TWS.look wise is good.but  i have facing noise issue.if i put one song it going smooth then i pause that song some noise is coming .in my point Bluetooth  version problem then i am using to connect different mobile phone the same issue came  noise is over high.if i have use 1 hour TWS in my ears is paining and noise(uuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrr) is coming .what i do .that product is not return.
Boat surely knows how to provide customers with absolute value for the buck. The product feels premium. Easily feels like a 4-5k worth tws. It gets a C type charging port now that's something isn't common for tws buds. The sound is absolutely amazing. Yes they're bass oriented bit still overall sound quality is way too good for the price. I got them for 1600 during Diwali sale on Amazon so if your budget is within 2K then go for these without even comparing it to the other products at this price range.
"Product was wonderfully packed, no single bend or tempering on box.When opened it made me feel super rich.Quality of product was awesome.The sound quality after tasted in ears was incredible.Noise canceling i would give 8/10 and still wonderfull for a Bluetooth device.Bass is accurate,So simple and easy to use functions.Battery life of case is goodI used them for while day.Had to charge them 3 times,And then at end of day, I charge it overnight.So wonderful.Used them while jogging and workout.Even in terribly sweaty conditions, they work super fine."
"For the price point, this is amazing.I like bass in my music and the product doesn't fail to deliver on that aspect. I sometimes have to talk loudly than normal but that could also be due to network issues. Connects seamlessly to devices too. The factory ear tips are soft but I may need to adjust it to a bigger one given in the box. Battery life is good too."
"Okay, so I purchased this after much researching and checking out array of budget and premium earbuds/ pods. Each and everyone of it had mix reviews. I purchased these, with having an experience of great customer service from boat regarding any issues with the device, returns, warranty, etc. The more you search, the lesser options you'll see. I decided to go with this. Initial product was delivered the next day ( hats off to prime delivery) the device had some issue as it didn't disconnected and the call quality had some issues. I initiated a return, got a replacement. Had the same issue. Finally asked for a refund, and purchased another product, same seller just different product. It has been more than a week. Sound is clear, the bass quality is amazing. The call quality to the receiving end is good ( could be great) as it just has 6 mm drivers, nonetheless the quality is really good for 2400/- what I loved it when while working out ( cardio, HIIT and all) the ear buds didn't fall off. And given I was using it throughout the day. The buds are really light too. The touch controls are good as well. Over all it's a really good product."
"Ok , I have used for couple of day and had experience on both front  . As a user as well as a listenerFirst. I will go with listener - voice is clear their is no humming sound from the other endOnly issue is when we say noise cancellation for listener then it is not their they can hear clear voice of what u are doing like playing with pen or opening of drawers etc.As a user - battery last for 4-5 hours which is good even when u play music,talk over call.Sound quality is good it is clear only issue is , it had too much of bass which kill quality of songs or other musical instrument music . So after you tend to remove them from your ears.Wearable- it is easy to wear even during sports activities like jog , walk . They can hold on all jurk . Still not tested in water 😁 but I am not going to dare it."
"I have been using these air dopes for about a week now. The dopes are sleek small and fit well into the ear. When on, I only get to hear the music and nothing on. The dopes are responsive, sometimes a little too much as a simple touch can pause / skip / or start new song.The case is good. Only thing to watch out will be to see how long the lids last given the usage.Battery backup is great. I used it 4 hours at a stretch without any issues and atleast 15 hours with one charge of the case. The sound quality is great for the price of the air dopes. Easy to use and beautiful looking too. Overall a great purchase!"
Got my earphones before the date.. Thanks amazon for faster delivery. Earlier product it got was defective as its rubber was torn and right piece speaker was not clear at other end. But it was replaced very early. Using this tws for almost one month. I use it mainly for calling purpose. Right piece is good for calling as the person on the other end can hear me clearly but with left piece other side is not that much clear. So boat must provide clarity on both pieces.For music purpose boat is as usual good.Battery backup is good. And case get charge fast.There must be a option to stop blinking of led. Sometimes it is irritating
"The product is overall extremely good who want to use it for music and calls both. Music stream delay is hardly noticable but sometimes delay can be observed if you're streaming in HD/4k quality on YouTube or other platform. Calling is really good. I talked to my friend on call in busy streets of Mumbai and he was able to hear me with much noise in the background, so recommended for calling as well. Microphone on this TWS is unbeatable by any other brand in this price range. I have 3 TWS and none of them can beat the sound and mic quality of this one.THE BIGGEST CON:I was talking to my colleague on call while I was walking and suddenly the left earbud ran out of battery and I was only left with one earbud to attend the call which is hard because you hear noise from the other ear. I had to close my ears with my hand to listen. If you intend to call only from house then this is good to go.I think both earphones must run at the same time and must provide equal battery life."

Pros-1.Noise cancellation is good which i tested in Bangalore traffic( Don't expect any premium air pods active noice cancellation in this one )2.Fitting perfect in the ear3.Bass is ok but i felt its more on the treble side.3.Battery back up is also good.4. Its providing a nice bluetooth coverage around 8-10 m for me( in open) with out any voice breakage or distractions.Cons:-1.Outer cover lid is made of cheap plastic especially hinge.2.Blue tooth connectivity is bit slow3.Capacitive touch sceen is not tgat much responsive. this is the main pblm i felt.All over if we compare all tgese i feel this is some thing good at this price.
"Hi I ordered this earphones as I needed to multitask with my kid and taking office calls. The ease of use is great and ear buds fit well. Also the battery life is quite good .. I use it for  almost 2 hours daily and i charge it once in 2-3 days. A couple of changes I would prefer, the end call is super sensitive and one needs to be very careful not to touch earphones when the call is on going else you’ll get dropped off. Also there is no option to mute the call by touching the earphones. This would be super helpful to go completely hands free."
"Sound - 8/10Bass - 9/10Looks awesomeBuild quality GreatBattery backup GoodFeel comfortable in the earsTouch response GreatPairing very fast, once paired the next time it gets connected within a second on opening the boxPersonally I didnt find any noise from the left earbud which many have experienced.Overall a great product at 2499. I was a bit tensed on reading the reviews before getting the buds on hand. But when I put them on my ears, guys, believe me all my doubts vanished. The sound quality is so great considering the price of the buds.  You guys can blindly go for the buds without any hesitation.But one thing I must say considering the latest price 3499, its a bit overpriced. Thankyou"
It's one of the best products. The sound quality while listening to music or calling is really great. And also the design of the case and airdopes is awesome!!Boat is one of the best brands and I love it!!!!! It's worth buying.
I bought in May2021. The product was dysfunctional with in 2weeks of purchase. I raised complaint in the boat website and it was picked up by Bluedart for service. But I didn't receive any communication from Boat later. I tried to contact boat customer care multiple times and could reach after multiple attempts initially. Got excuses from them citing COVID. But no response later. So far I called customer care 10times. Each time only apologies and excuses from them. Not even a single email from them. I sent copy of acknowledgement of Bluedart pickup also. Very apathic and callous response. I literally feel my product is lost.

 It is no doubt a 5 star product.I have had boat products before and as its an Indian based company, I support it a lot. It's all a genuine opinion of mine. I bought boat rockers 400 on-ear headphones and for like 2 years they worked ,were awesome, and I had no issues ever. They still work! I just broke the plastic over head band ,but the electronics still work. It's great value for money.Then I bought this. For this let me say.I was going to buy 441 but kept it in my wishlist but then the pro version came,Nothing different but they added a big battery as a power bank! Simple but great idea. I have them now for 2 months and guess how many times I've charged it? Only once.The product is mind-blowing. I rarely give 5 stars to anyone except when it's Perfect. And it's perfect value for money.There is a rubber part around the earphones, you turn it and dude forget about them falling out. The pairing speed is Virtually nothing. See the video, it's paired. Open it and it pairs in 2 seconds (for device connected before of course) . Of course you can use it as a power bank too , you need a USB to whatever type your phone needs. It's awesome. Sound quality is also great and the range too. Seamless talks on calls clear audio.No doubt it's like 5th largest wearable electronics brand in the world. It's this excellent products they make.I'm proud of this company as an Indian too. Cheers.(One note: you have to take care with the capacitive touch on both the earphones during calls as even at slightest touch, it ends the call, happened with me a lot in the beginning)"
"UPDATE: Sept 21It's been more than a year using these earphones. It's truly worth the price. I use it daily almost 6-7 hours in good time interval, take calls also thru these, these works fine.sound quality and functions are still intact.------------------------Prodyct is really good.Good fit, good playback time of 2-3 hours if continuously used, Good noise cancellation. Very light weight.case is also nice, You dont have to keep it on charging always.Fancy lights on the touch panel really looks good.it's good one in this range.Problem:Touch is very sensitive. By the time you open and try to put it in ear, it turns off if you kept your finger on the touch panel.I would have liked gew more features like touch response to finger only, With some apps pause play is not supported.but it has all the basic features."
"These earphones have a highly sensitive CTC (Capacitive Touch Control) which is located around the whole rounded rectangular area around the boAt logo on both the earbuds. There are several touch controls for separate functions to be controlled directly from the earbuds without touching the phone.The audio quality of the boAt Airdopes 441 TWS Ear-Buds is amazing. The highs and lows are up to the mark. When the volume is 100% the sound has a soothing effect. The 6mm audio driver is quite good as the sound goes very high when at 100%.The comfort of these earbuds is unparalleled. The ear tips are soft and fit perfectly in-ear. It is firm in the ears, and there is no problem of falling from the ear.Pros:LightweightEar gripRGB lightingEasy CTC control18 hours playtimeSweat and Water-resistantUSB Type-C chargingCons:Individual earbud playtimeBluetooth range"
Product is good. Sound Quality and Noise Cancellation are good not as good as the high end items but for the price under 2500 these air dopes are good. These works well with the phones. But these are not useful for webex meetings on laptop (Other side cannot hear you).. But the one side of Air dopes stopped working after 10 days. And the Boat Support is very lengthy. Though it is well structured it takes a huge lot of time to replace or repair the product. I had raised a support ticket on Boat Support portal on 10th of October 2020 and today is 19th ot Oct 2020. The product is still in transit and not yet reached the Boat store (Mumbai) where they will verify and repair or replace the product. Whole process takes 18-20 Business days as per them. No Boat support center near by in Hyderabad city to repair the product. It has to be sent to Mumbai where they will repair the product. This is too big process.Update 28/Oct/2020: Product sent for repair on 10th Oct 2020 and until now I didn't hear any update on when the product will be repaired or replaced. Worst customer support. Can't connect to BOAT Support Center. I'm going to raise Complaint in Consumer Court.
"For the price, can't complain about the sound signature. Passive noise cancellation, especially while playing music isn't half bad either. Connecting to a device/switching connections though - I have honestly not used a device this bad in connecting to devices in a decade. Either it keeps disconnecting, or only one of it plays any sound. All the rules in the manual is of no help either. Buy this if you're only going to ever connect this to ONLY ONE device in it's entire lifetime and not even think of trying to connect it to a new device after you've set up the first one. Also, most of the steps to factory reset/""fix common problems"" in the manual does not work. This fundamental flaw just cripples the entire experience.For Boat: please fix conection issues! You're killing your own product with an issue that has been solved a decade back.Update (Apr 2021): after ""trying"" to use these for the last 4-5 months, I have come to the conclusion that these are a literal waste of money. Buyers beware - if you're getting good connectivity and your earphones are working fine, that's awesome. But you really shouldn't risk your money on this. Please DO NOT buy this. I cannot speak for any other Boat products, but definitely recommend against this one. Never going to try Boat earphones personally."
"I bought both airdopes 441 and 441pro. This one the airdopes 441 have a horribly poor battery life, not only the headsets even the case. I have to always keep the case connected to a power bank. What is even the point. 45 min i am on a call and the battery of the airdopes die. Within 40-60 min battery is dead. Moreover, mic works only in one side not on both sides. I need a replacement."
"First things first, check ur package if it is repacked by amazon or seller. If it doesn’t seem so and looks like it has boat stickers, you are tearing the boat sticker to open the package then it’s un-used ORIGINAL  QUALITY BOAT product, you’d have nothing to complain but yourself.One more thing is people are complaining about one side ear bud being buzzing and all, you know what. In stereo mode ( both ear-buds in use ) the sound you get on each earbud is different that’s how stereo works, you can’t complain this as one side is buzzing other side is good, That’s INSANE STUPIDITY IF YOU COMPLAIN LIKE THAT.And some stupid people says that Call gets disconnected, You morons, it’s a touch assistive ear-bud if u touch it to adjust the earbud in ur ear during a call, it gets disconnected, isn’t this OBVIOUS? And yet you are putting it up as a complain that call gets disconnected during talking. THE STUPIDITY OF PEOPLE IS INFINITE.Well! I got the product, battery backup , worth the price , sound quality ,, what not? Whatever you can think of is SUPER AWESOME , YOU WON’T GET THIS MUCH QUALITY in this price range. I got it for Rs 1799/- on 21st jan,2021.Even if you buy SAMSUNG  BUDS or AIRPODS  for 13k or so, you still get the same QUALITY AND 5HRS BACKUP AS THIS 1800/- BOAT AIRDOPES 441. So, what do you choose is upto you!"
"OK. So, I bought them some 10 says back. Used them for over a week and then returned (replaced) them. This is because I was facing some difficulties with the mic. I fell in love with this product from the first use itself. The sound quality is AMAZING!! The features make it so easy to use. And it has that asthetic appeal to it.But, but... I was facing difficulties with mic, remember? This was especially with the laptop. Hence, I applied for the replacement. They brought the new pair in just a couple of days. But the problem still persisted with the new pair as well!! I was worried about having wasted the huge amount of money.But then I spent some time understanding the product. And found that the problem wasn't, in fact, with the product, but with the settings on my laptop. I had to increase mic volume on my laptop for them to work better!!I also found out another thing. While there is a mic on both the earbuds, only one of them works at a time. And the one working is the one that you picked out first from the box. So keep that in mind. This is not mentioned in the manual. (May be they should -_-) So, this ultimately resolved all my issues with the earbuds, and now I'm a very happy customer of these awesome earbuds. I would say, if you are OK with spending this much amount, just go for these ones!! You won't be disappointed!!!"
"People.The product is exactly as described and met all my personal requirements (Comfort, sound quality, ear-fit, water-proofing, style, budget etc). I did a lot of research and found this to the Best Value For Money (VFM) ear-buds. The best part (which I was actually quite concerned about) is that they don't budge while running/working out. Although there is no active noise cancellation, it has passive noise cancellation which is awesome at this price range.Also, it comes with a chic and handy carrying/charging case which has USB-C charging and fully charges my earbuds within less than 2 hours. By the way, this charging case has a massive battery life (I have not charged my case ever since I received from Amazon which was in sometime in mid-November and must have recharged my earbuds at least 15-20 times - no exaggerations here.)I am fully satisfied and am sure that you shall be too.Happy listening and working out.Cheers !!!"
"Must read review to all those thinking to purchase the Beauty!!🤩Design:This is one area I liked the Airdopes very much...Beautiful❤️Looks premium with lighting..🔥Comfort and durability:Very comfortable with most ear sizes and creates a perfect noise free experience. You can use it while exercise or workout. They won't fall out of ears even with intense workout.This ones come with IPX7 Resisant which protects from sweat and splash.Sound and Audio Quality:As expected in most BOAT products, bass is always boosted and the audio quality is amazing. Details in music can be heard very crisply. The perfect noise cancellation has a good hand over here.Latency:There is a small amount of latency observed while playing PUBG. Very minor amount though. At this price point it's very observable. Realme buds Air have low latency and also they are bit expensive.Call quality:Excellent!!Battery Backup:Amazing. 2600mah battery backup upto 150 hrs. Still testing it out. Will update laterFeature:Touch sensors on them work well.More testing is left definately will update this review."
"The earphones are not designed well enough to sit comfortably in the ear. The buds go in and are not problematic, but the body is not shaped to be a comfortable fit in the ear. It hurt a lot to keep the pods in for more than 15 minutes. I even changed the tips to solve the issue, but they kept falling out. Also the touch feature is overly sensitive and easily recognizes false touch. An accidental brush while pushing my hair out of my face also caused it to disconnect, when according to the user manual, it should require three taps to disconnect. While on call, the earphones constantly glitched out and sent distorted noises to the person I was talking to (I was sitting in a quiet environment, so there's no question of BG noise)I'm aware these pods don't feature noise cancellation, but they do glitch a lot. I also had issues with delayed bluetooth pairing. Maybe I received a faulty pair, but in three days I was fed up with the earphones and chose to return them. I'm not someone who buys without research, and this product was advertised to fit my needs. Unfortunately, it did not function to my expectations. I have been using Amazon for years and this is the first time I've had to return a product because I was so throughly dissatisfied with it.The airdopes could improve by providing a larger variety of tips and a better shape to fit in the ears. I really liked the Boat Rockerzz I had bought last year so wanted to try Boat again, however this purchase is making me question the brand."
"Writing this review after 6 months of usage.These earbuds are perfect when you want to use them just for listening to the music. The bass is perfect and audio output is truly marvellous. Battery life is also good. With the pods, it will give you backup of around 4 days. Touch is also quite sensitive.However, when it comes to mic, it is horrible. There is no noise cancellation (which is expected at this range) and you have to literally shout while speaking if you want your self heard. In a closed room, the performance is slightly better but not upto the mark. More trouble is there when you connect it with laptop. Mic performance is awfully bad.Overall, if you are looking for an earbud just for music streaming and can compromise with the mic, go for it."
I like that this product comes with insta wake and pair technology it connets the phone in just one second once it is paired it is really a good product i have tried by wetting it under tap then also it is working and it is true i have sincerly wetted it for 3 times on diffrent days under tap water then also it is working the bass quality is good the Instruments Vocals all are Good and Crisp Andif you are a baass lover then you will gaurntee fell the punchy bass  And the most i like is that the low latency is working good during watching movies palying PUBG CALL OF DUTY i have played all this games and there was no lag at all Hence it is a very Good TWS and i really have a trust on boAt as it promises what he tolds So i sincerly want to tell All people those who want to buy you can buy this for 2499 Rs as it is really A Good and A fully PAISA VASOOL PACKAGE From boAt (PLUG INTO NIRVANA)
"Sound quality awesome, comfortable, battery life, charging case very small and light weight,Used for pubg  works well there is no lag, sound from AWM comes awesome,Doesnot fall untill you take it out from your ear, used untill battery died worked for 3+ hrsDont compare with expensive  ones like bose and jbl"
"Pros:Good sound qualityTouch is amazing equal to feather touchCase is hard and scratch proofProperly fixed in earsGood noise cancellationBass at its bestestSweat proof and water resistant is super coolWith just touch call siri Alexa or Google assistantPlay previous or next song is perfectCons:Have to control volume manuallyPersonally I loved the master piece. Helps in many ways like while working in kitchen, gym, WFH, specially who's ears get blocked while traveling to hillstation or in flight5 star"
"after 2 months of usage, battery hardly lasts for 2½ hours and there's some problem with the power bank, when it's battery reaches below 35%, it stops charging, I complained about it, but the replacement I received had the same problem. also, I didn't like the replacement because, the first time I ordered my product, it was of blue color, the replacement I received were of black color but I didn't got any accessories like the replacement ear plugs of the same colour. as I have big ear holes, I have to use blue colored ear plugs in black earphones. disappointed."
"Review after 9 month usage.Pros: The sound quality and noise cancellation are good.Cons:1. The battery is horrible. The right ear pod loses battery quickly. And within a year the battery and charging case are not able to hold up much charge.2. The touch part is horrible. If you're listening to music lying down and you turn to your side and the touch sensitive part of the pod touches the pillow, it pauses music, and even turns off as if it has been done by a finger.3. The notification voice is super irritating! I don't want someone to say, ""Oops! Battery Low!"" to me everytime the battery is low, which is very often. A simple beep can do justice to the notification."
"1) Takes some effort to remove from case2) Sync issues observed at times3) Sometimes( twice a day minimum) Audio suddenly goes off on either of the earphones, there is no pattern to this behaviour ( which is more difficult because it can't be replicated)4) No way you can control the volume from the budsDon't know what to do.Waiting for it to completely die so that I can claim warranty.But still go for it - I love boat so much that I am ok to work around these difficulties.Every boat item I have bought from rockers to stone - they have performed best.I am still getting used to this one - hope it happens soon."
1) sounds quality excellent 👌2) bass owsume 👌3)one important thing is that do not change with fast charger I have charged for 15 min with fast charger casebox got heat so be careful please charge with normal 5 v charger it take time around 1 and half  hour but it not get heat with normal chargeIn Question answer it has mention that can charge with fast charger
"Product was quite good for listening music Don't expect Premium bass levels.I think all the pros are mentioned in detailed product description let's talk about cons:1. After fixing in the ears for 20 minutes and above you might feel slight ear pain2. Attending calls are quite easy but either you nor them can't listen opposite person voice after 10 mins ( happened to me everytime might be I received a defective piece)3. If you are frequently going outdoor I don't recommend this product better go for neckband type ( because everytime you need to put the airdopes in the dedicated case to power it off)4. Designed in such a way, you can't find the one if you lost it ( Easy to pairup also easy to lose)5. Case is not easily fitting in pocket, always you need something to store the case which stores the airdopes 😂"
"I ordered this Airdopes set mainly for taking work related calls through communication technologies like Slack, Microsoft Teams etc. The initial set I received worked well but had two issues:1. The left hand side airdope kept disconnecting and reconnecting.2. The call quality was good, but the other party could barely hear me.I pondered over a poor review, but then I changed my mind and checked boat's website. I got their support email and sent them my invoice details. I had barely sent the email when I got a response telling me to keep it ready in a box (any box other than the original box) for pickup. The next day, the delivery exec from Boat had picked it up. I got an acknowledgement email stating that the set had been duly received and that they would be shipping a replacement for me. It was supposed to take 15-20 days. But surprise surprise! It was delivered in 3 days, and now this set is working perfectly. Comfortable, light, looks durable, sounds good and the microphones are definitely good!I'm so glad to have waited before putting in my review. The person at the other end has no trouble hearing me and the buds stay in sync without getting disconnected. I don't have any intention of using this to listen to music, but whatever I have heard while being on hold has sounded really good.Overall I'm very satisfied. And one appeal to everyone - please don't leave a poor feedback based on one experience. Do reach out to their customer support. They are very easy to work with. It might take a a few more days, but these Airdopes are worth it. Sincere thanks to Boat for their wonderful customer service and Amazon for bringing this product to us!"
"1. The music quality is very good especially bass.2. More ergonomic design so that it fits perfectly into ears so that you can even ride bicycle, bike, walk, run and do exercise without fear of dropping.3. Power efficient - charge indicator available, do not drain out easily, hardly requires charging.4. Complete noise cancellation5. You can pair single piece also for calls.6. Only drawback is that in small spaces like small rooms, the mic captures more background noice during calls."
The product is good overall and a value for money product. But there is a static when nothing is being played which is a little annoying at times.
"10/10 Would recommend this product. Used for a week before I ended up loosing up the carrying case so please don't be like me and make sure you keep the case safe or else you won't be able to charge the earphones. Coming on to the tws itself, The quality is really nice and it has satisfying click each time one would close the case lid. The sound quality is awesome the mids are clear and highs are good. But in bass heavy songs the bass sometimes over powers the mids but that's subjective. The fit of tws are good and fit nicely inside the ear hole. The mic quality is clear and the battery would last around 3.8-4 hours on normal 90% volume use. If battery is pirority for you then please buy one plus bullet wireless z."
"Quality of the product is decent, Sound is good with rich bass, good for music, or during workout session of 2hrs. The L bud losses it's battery exactly  by 2 hrs of continious music playback, the R bud runs out by 2.5 hrs. Call quality is ok, but in crowded placeses mic dissappoints, have to speak loud or repeat twice or thrice, but in this price point i would not expect more. The buds can be charged thrice + with the case. In case of silent placeses not voice issues. Both the ear buds can be used as single while the alternate bud battery gets drained, and can be charged single by the battery case provided and vice varsa.This is review of one week of use..i would update later. Overall i ill mark it 3 out 5."
"the product is amazing but I feel these are the things to be noted before buying this productPROS1. stylish2. amazing case3. felt the value for money4. it has call answering and rejecting features5. pairs instantly with your device and the pods talk to each other6. You can use the pods in monopod mode7. the  case has an amazing light feature that indicates the battery levels of the charging case8. they claim it to be waterproof but i haven't really tried testing it9. pods have beautiful light which indicates various modes (red green and blue)10. fits good in ur ear11. amazing for listening to songs12. beautiful feature of voice assistant13. it has extra rubber pads with diff sizes and also has a rubber ring-like thing that grips ur wear14. they give u the c type cable15. they come in trendy colours (4 types)CONS1. very bad noise cancellation / no noise cancellation2. case is good but the hinge is very delicate and u need to hold it open else it closes3. girls need to be careful when they let their hairs lose and they try this product because if u wear this pods with one or a few hair strands in ur ears its bound to fall and chances of spoiling it or losing it4. I felt battery durability could have been even better for the price we  are paying i.e. 2469 odd rs5. it has some issues with the call .i used this pods for some calls as soon as I bought it the other person on call couldn't hear at some  point of time because of some random disturbance, and once I took it off the call was clear6. though they give u the c type cable they don't give u the adapter so pls read the instructions clearly before charging ur case and hope u burn down the case by using the wrong adapters.7. the pods don't have the feature where it tells u if u have worn the pods properly like in air pods (in air pods it tels u when the pods are lost)8. same model doesn't come in girly colours if incase u are looking out for pink or if u are expecting whiteoverall I wud say its amazing go for if u feel all the features u wanted are not there then you can go for the ones having most of the features if not all but the price is dramatically high.."
"Been using the product since a day now. I'm not stunned by the quality but I'm abundantly satisfied with the purchase. The controls will take sometime getting used to, keep the user guide handy for quick reference for sometime till you get accustomed.The earpieces are comfortable, the sound quality great and it easily paired with my iPhone X and Macbook. Since the product supports mono functionality as well, it may cause confusion sometimes - My left earphone paired with my laptop and the right one paired with my phone at the same time. It was a bit surreal.Great product though. At the price point, I highly recommend a purchase!"
"Love the battery life. I'm quite new to the TWS market. Bought thus airdopes 441 pro for my dad. My cheaper 700rs Sony and JBL CS series headphones have much better audio richness and audio spacing depth. This airdopes are fine too. But I'm not impressed at all. With equalizer, I play around with it to find a better sound suit for me but still, these 700rs wired headsets do much better.Calling too isn't that good, I sit for meetings with this and I often get people from the opposite saying I sound distant or voice level is low. I don't think this has noise cancelations, haven't properly checked that.Overall, this thing is portable, wireless and works on Bluetooth, cool technology stuff, that's all. Not meant for audiophiles and calling purposes.If you gift this to old people like your parents and grandparents, they'll love it."
"The product is good, I like the sound quality. Bass is also good. Call quality is average. If you talk normally, person will hear your voice without any problem. Not sure about the outside.This airdopes is not good for gaming. You will hear the gun sound after one sec. But if you want the airdopes for music and calling indoor, its a good one.Sometime, both airdopes doesn't pair, you simply need to put it back in the case and then open it, it will solve the problem, or factory reset. That's not a big problem I guess. If you know how to wear the airdopes, then there will be no fitting issue.Battery back up is good.Overall, I like the air dopes. Worth it.I received the airdopes yesterday. I will update after one month."
1st. Thanks amazon for same day delivery. I am also using rockerz 255 but these are really awesome airdopes from boat.2nd. The overall packaging & build quality is really amazing.3rd. Charging case is superb.4th. Sound is crystal clear.5th. Bass is superb. Only for those who love bass. Thumbing bass. Earphones are quite loud at 50percent volume. Easily fits in ear. Doesnt fell during workout.6th. Touch sensitivity is gud. Easy to pair.
"After many months of analysis with many company i brought this boat 4411st time i using this airpodesGood sound quailty- 10/10NCS 10/10BASS 100/100 EXCELENT BASS... LOOK LIKE IN A THEATER WITH DTS EFFECTTOUCH 10/10CALLING 10/10VOICE ASSIST 10/10 OVER ALL 10/10Battery after 2 days use i charged only once... Always it show 80-100% battery in earbudsU can use any one as a mono pods both are master podsU can use for 2 different device but not on same time, if 1 is connected and in use u cant use the 2 one, u need to disconnet either 1 buds and use it..Mainly u can use while driving a car.Boat is a good company"
"Unlike many of us, I also did many onlline survey and read teh old reviews of other amazon customers. And i shortlisted this ear buds. And now i can say, i made a correct choice. Great product, easy in ears, best price and great outout sound. You dont have to think again. And yes the charging box is also a mini power backup battery for mobiles."
"The heading sums up everything. The touch panel (CTC) has manufacturing defect. I am writing this after using two productsts. In first case the right bud stopped completely after 2 days of use. Its ctc used to be very sensitive and you will struggle getting correct output basis touch command. In second case, the ctc had no touch response. No light signal, lying dead after its removal from the case, especially the right side one. I tried, restarted, made the factory reset several time, tried different pressure points just to keep my new buds with me and wasted several hours. But response was not encouraging. Sometimes it responded, sometime it simply ingoned my touch command, in the middle of my call, listing music. Finally, with heavy heart i have requested return of this product. The reason for my heavy heart is the music sound quality. Its a good buy (even as a faulty product) for Rs. 300 budget (max), for those who just wish to listen music. Totally unhappy with the product."
"Look is good.Volume with music is okay(not fantastic).Average bass.Mics are good.But...Call volume is unsatisfying, its very low... Have to increase to 100% to listen clearly.Requested to return and horrible thing is that they provided a long description to return by myself.(They're not picking it back)😥Update****With the help of Customer care executive, at another Pin code they accepted the pick up and I successfully returned the product."
"Sound quality is good but very inconsistent connectivity. The pairing was easy but no longevity in connection. Either one of the buds disconnects frequently which is a huge headache while working out since you won't carry the case with you. I was tempted by the IPX7 certification but trust me this is a huge letdown.I have replaced this product 2 times as one of the earbuds was dead 2 times. This is something you should worry about. So you cannot trust the lifespan of these earbuds, it could be the end the very next minute. My suggestion would be to go with any brand which has better service/support after-sales"
"TALKING ABOUT THE BOAT AIRDOPES 4411) Look and feel - It is tremendous, compact and has a premium look, it fits into the pocket easily and it is also very light weight. The black colour is loved by many people so does me!  There are also other options available, you can watch them too!2) Sound quality - The name 'Boat' itself is a representation of Perfect and loud sound and also the king of base. The sound is loud and clear and also the base is excellent and I would definitely love to recommend to the user who loved loud music and also want the perfect base.The call quality was good as per the price. The other user on phone was able to hear me clear.Along with that, they have provided us with the earhooks so that it doesn't get off from the ear and it just blocks your ear perfectly and you don't have to be tensed about it's falling off from the ear. Also it's IPX rated so it is water resistance with a type C charging.The charging time of the case and buds are good as per the price.If I summerise overall, then You must definitely choose this 'BOAT AIRDOPES 441' that would contain everything including loud sound and base and also sleek and compact case which gives a premium look.OVERALL , you can go for it!"
Good earbuds but no difference between 441 and 441 pro except the powerbank feature. Bought this 441 pro and in 1.5 weeks one side stopped working (major 200 rs earphone vibes). Returned product after claiming warranty and Its been more than 1 month now with no update from Boat.
"It is just rambling bass, with many details lost while listening to music. It responds well to EQ, but problem persists. I bought it for a specific purpose - listening to recorded calls - it serves me well. Battery life is good. Passive isolation is nice. Personally, I did not want to spend a fortune over something which would die in 2 - 3 years. These TWS are also bad for calls. It prioritises background noise over call. Also, they're not good for ladies with long hair. A single strand of hair is enough to stop or pause whatever you are doing - the touch is too sensitive.PS: Though it doesn't bother me, they are made in China. Also, TWS technology has a long, long way to go."
"Not worth it!No noise cancellation makes it extremely difficult for receiver to hear the conversation. Even a fan in the background makes it unbearable to talk. The ultra sensitive touch on both pods gets the calls disconnected every time you try to adjust the pods in your ears. Would surely not recommend this product.Branding online says it is an Indian Company. However when received the product, it mentions MADE IN PRC (Peoples Republic of China).  Surely misleading and ethically incorrect.Tried to return the product and did not give me an option for Returns as well."
"Previously, I used Redmi Airdots for almost a year or so, and back in October, I finally decided to upgrade as I was facing a few problems with it, related to battery and usability. And after using BoAt Airdopes 441, I can say for a fact that these are generations better than Airdots. Not only do they have extremely rich sound quality, but the bass is very noticeablely deep. The fit is very nice, and can be used while working out. The battery is everlasting, and the biggest pro about these wireless earbuds is the bluetooth 5.0  as it's extremely quick, and easy to connect. Definitely an easy buy for this budget."
"Though the sound output is very good, but the various functionalities are all too confusing. There are three kinds of light: red, blue and green ... There are functions for one tap, two tap, three taps with other functions of long press for 2, 3 and five seconds... It's all too confusing."
"This is a decent ear bud pair in this price range. Have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I haven't faced anything I'd call a problem till now. Here are a few pros and cons per me (but my views will definitely be relative and driven by my expectations); please note that I won't talk about sound features but I usually use this for phone calls, business meetings, etc., and it gets my work done nice & easy:Pros:1) Light weight2) Boots up instantly upon opening the case3) Decent range (tested for > 10m)4) Bluetooth 5.0 (but also supports 4.x)5) Stable mono mode (either bud can be used independently, without stereo features)6) Stereo ear buds (when both work together)7) Seamless auto-pairing between the two buds8) Quickly reconnects with previously paired deviceCons:1) Learning curve involved to understand all features and touch controls2) Light coding can get a bit confusing at times (but this is more of a feedback to UX designers of this product and has no performance impact on the buds once you've got a hang of all that those lights mean)3) For some people, battery back up can be a bit less but please do take a look at the size and weight; plus, don't forget the mono mode"
"The sound quality is excellent (for the price). Good bass quality is only felt after 65% volume. Noise cancellation is good. The fitting is comfortable for 1-2 hours, beyond that it starts to mild ache. Battery back up seems to be 3 Hours+, not 5 hours as stated on the box.CONNECTIVITY ISSUE: Headphone sound output is often lagging. Left headphone is disconnecting regularly. To connect again, I have to switch off and switch on it. Battery back up is not as per advertised. Requested for replacement, I'll update the review after the replacement comes."
"I have just used it for a week purchased during Amazon Independence day sale.Fit in the ear without any issues and are comfortable. I have always been skeptical about comfort since long hour music is my first choice. This one fits in properly.Not good at high volume and is too loud. Listen at low or medium volume only.Also, I can hear the air in the ear (Extra feature) :-(Touch controls are excellent and work as expected.My only concern right now is that one of them keeps on showing red light whenever I pull them out. They do pair automatically, but most of the time one of them just switches off. I am not able to use it in mono mode.Maybe a reset is required that I will give it a try.Was worth a purchase during the deal only. Otherwise, I feel they are too costly for this price and features."
"Very happy with the product but very disappointed with the fact that the box was already tampered with when delivered by Amazon. The original seal was ripped off and pasted randomly on the box and a separate seal was applied on the box (refer the photographs for reference). In all likelihood, this is a product that was returned by some other customer and Amazon hasn't bothered to check the packaging before shipping it out to me. While the product looks brand new / unused and seems to be working fine, this experience has left me extremely skeptical as to whether or not these would last and give me the reliability and performance of a brand new product.As for the product in itself, it is great and delivers on aesthetics, build quality, sound (great bass for the price!) as well as ease of use. Fits comfortably in the ears and can be used for long periods of time without any irritation / uneasiness. The charging dock is small enough to easily fit in the pocket and I really like the overall touch and feel of the product. All in all, would definitely recommend it if you're looking for reasonably priced airbuds!Hopefully, you would receive these in a brand new packaging without any tampering.."
"I purchased it to use it for office calls and Teams/Zoom meetings.1. Both left and right plugs are not in sync. During the calls, I get voice in right side first and left side later. there is some mm second difference but it makes difficult to listen words during calls.2. If there is little fluctuation of internet or anything during calls, it stops working and robot kind of sound starts coming. I have to disconnect the call and rejoin to let it work again.3. any time it stops working completely. within 5 minutes of use or so.Don't go  for this if you want to use it for calls."
"First of all lets talk about the build qualityAlso the placement of the earbuds is very good.Dont even fall from the caseSound quality: the quality is good and alos the people who love bass this buds are for them..Battery life awesome....The only thing i didnt like is that the sound is little bit low..not very low but a little low.There was a issue with many buyers that the left bud hissing sound...Let me tell you that it was a old issue and is fixed.There is not even a minute hissing sound in my airdopes.. so dont worry..of that.Bass is awesome and noise cancellation is also the best....After 4 monthsCheap qualityCap came in handVery low sounding compared to othersEg sony, jbl, noise etcDont go for it very badSound ok."
Product is good and design is Also good but size of ear bud is very big not getting fit in ears and for calling it is not good voice of another person is not getting clear and on call other person is getting our other noises instead of our voice so noise cancellation is very poor.
"It is a good product for the price.Pros:1. Good sound quality for calls and movies.2. Size and pocket friendly.3. Within the budget.Cons:1. Can't use with multiple devices, it gets connected to random one of the many devices you use and not very easy to disconnect and connect to the required device.2. Not great for music, as the bass is substandard.3. Can't be used as workout pods, as they are not tight.4. touch is over sensitive, pauses if anything even brushes against it.Over All:Good for a single user with single device, for gaming and calls.I was planning to use on my Phone and TV, it just doesn't connect to TV unless I switch off Bluetooth in my phone. Similar problem can be faced if any of your family member wants to share it."
"I brought it for Rs.1399/- and one of the best among this price range.Sound quality: Better sound quality than many of branded rivals.Build quality: Premium look and plastic is sturdy. Looks more branded and compact design. Little pain while using for hours(it can be eradicated when outer wings removed)Bass quality: Enough bass but not much. Bass quality is more than boat 141, realme buds q2 and oppo enco buds.Battery: Used 6 hrs per day for 4 days. Still blue indicator is showing. Battery backup is very good.Touch controls are really responsive. Not responses to accidental touch.Instant pairing technology, BT 5.2, IPx4 water resistant.Cons:No volume control (can't expect in this price range)Size is compatible but little bulky in pocket.Bass is very good but not punchy(but it is enough)Best airdopes from boat. Thanks Amazon"
"I received this 2 days after ordering. Got it on the lightning deal @ 2499. So far, I've been using it for approx 4 hours continuously and haven't faced any problems. Now here's the stuff you are reading this review for :1. Fits super snugly in the ears. I've shakwn my head every which way, jumped around, vigorously too,  and even fallen asleep with these on. They haven't fallen out even once. Yeah maybe if you get punched in the face they could fall off, but i haven't tested that yet! If you use the right earbud size it will fit better i guess. The earcaps are pretty useless in this regard though. They do nothing. Just use the right earbud size ans push it in properly.2. Sound quality is great like you expect from any boat product. The bass is what you bought this for and it won't disappoint. I tested this at both safe and full volumes on my samsung m21 and while the full volume won't make your ears bleed, it's powerful enough to make you uncomfy after 5 minutes. In safe volume state, these are pretty great. Of course i compared these with the brand new boat bassheads 225 i have, and the output from those is louder at the same volume. But that's what i have noticed in a lot of boat products, their bluetooth stuff plays a little softer at the same volume when compared to the regular earphones.Clarity is otherwise good and everything is balanced. You won't need to tweak with the equaliser unlike what happened with the Boult earphones I've used.Call quality is pretty decent too. You can hear the person clearly, no problem there. My friend did say that she could hear my voice clearly, though it'd sound better if i was louder, but I'm in general a very loud speaker. So there's that.3. Looks pretty decent when worn. The touch controls are a little confusing to gt used to without reading the manual 2 times or more. Of course the touch controls are great, but not too fast. They have some delay.4. Charging takes about 1 hour and a bit more. I haven't tested them for how long they can go without another charge so that's next to come.5. The case looks super cute though? It's got a matte finish and you get 3 pairs of earbuds and that earcap thing, a charging type C cable and warranty card and manual.These aside, i can't come up any more points. I hope this review helps.P. S. : i got the bumblebee yellow."
"Bought on June 9th , June 25th right ear pice stopped working , June 30th Left one stopped connecting to any bluetooth divide.what Star should I give . worst buy from Amazon"
"I got this on my birthday on 21st June :) Was initially skeptical regarding the quality of TWS earbuds. But having used other Boat earphones in the past made me go for this over other brands.Using it since unboxing on 21st June and even after 2 days of heavy usage, the charge is still available in the box. Earbuds can go on 4-5hrs on a single charge. Battery backup is indeed good as advertised.Music quality is very good just like any other Boat earphones.Call quality and noise cancellation is better than what I had expected.Haven't tried gaming mode as I am not a gamer but I expect it will be good too.Earbuds are comfortable to the ears even after continuous usage and fit to the ears well.Box pack comes with extra ear tips and a USB Type C charger.Its really worth spending Rs 2500."
"Product is an average one the sound quality is good and the bass is average, Noise cancellation is 3.6/5 and the battery back up is between 2-3.5 hours based on the purpose. Better battery back up when using volume between 70-80%. One replacement buds offered with the product for quite smaller ear size. Type C charging is faster but using QC or Turbo or Vooc for charging might create heating issues standard charger will do. Use one at a time to have better usage cycle."
Very good airdope and very beautiful look wise also better sound quality but it's not louder. Infact when your volume label on 80+ than you can real enjoy any song. So i think volume/louder factor should have been better. Clearity and connectivity is outstanding. Specially connectivity distance performance is best in class. No any pain feeling on my ears. Great fixed with both ears. I will give the feedback later about battery backup. Overall it's a great product under this budget 2.5k.
"The claimed battery life of 3 hours is not there, thus I would recommend to go for the Pro model with 5 hours of battery life.Otherwise, product is good, lightweight and decent looking.I used it for my Zoom calls and other webinars. Didn't last more than 2 hours of continuous uses. Music playback audio is okay, not out of this world.Yet to use it on Phone Calls."
"I bought Airdopes 441 Blue in October last year on Amazon. The Earphones worked just fine for 3/4 months, since then the rapid degradation started.....the right earphone lost its volume(minimal output), and since last month the left earphone which was performing at optimal level lasts only about 10 mins.I am still within my warranty period but the claim process is abysmal. I am based in capital city of Odisha and there's only one recognised service center to claim warranty. they don't pickup calls and are 20kms away from me. In these covid times travelling there is very difficult for me.I WISH bOAT introduces online warranty claim and replacement service. i mean brands like senheise,sony provide online replacement within a week. VERY DISSAPOINTED....i bought a Sony earphone now and never looking forward to buy a bOAT product in future.MY POINTS;1. Didn't last a year2.Difficult & unresponsive Warranty claim process.3. Yes I paid around ₹ 2000 for using a Bluetooth earphone for 10 months.NEVER AGAIN bOAT!!!!!!!!"
Buzzing noise coming from right side bud. You didn't notice it at the time of music but when you pause the music or changing track you will notice that.Don't buy it if you watch movie at night because it's so irritating.I placed a replacement request. Let's see if the new one has same problem or not.I will update my review after receiving the product.
"My first true wireless earbuds! Very good sound quality. Bass is nice, though not very thumpy (I don't prefer very high bass anyway, masks lows). Good battery life as well, full charged once and after 8 days still going strong, though I use for around 1 hour of listening in one go. Case is good, instantly connects to mobile/tablet. Touch controls are good, too sensitive for my liking though. Comfortable to wear as well, you need to find best position for your liking that's it! I have forgotten to take them off a couple of times after listening, these are that comfy! Overall nice buds."
"No complain about the sound quality, it's good in this range. But what irked me to write this review, it's earpod's touch buttons, they are nightmares!This product is such a waste of money because of the touch buttons alone, I can't rest my kneck on either sides because it pauses the music or the video I'm watching. Same goes for call. Terrible concept Boat! Slow claps. The only satisfaction I'm getting from this waste of a product is by informing people and save their money!"
These are one of the best ear phone in that price range.. they fit in-ear nicely and anr comfortable over extended length of time.The noise cancellation is superb..!!! Like you literally can't hear anything from the outside..The bass quality is great especially if you use both the dopes simultaneously...The touch panel is sensitive and functional.The only drawback is that the volume can only be controlled by your phone as there is no volume control function on the eardopes.
"Sound quality:- Good for it's price range. The sound leans a little bit on the treble side but it has sufficient lows. I was actually surprised by the sound quality considering that it is a bluetooth earphone at the 2.5k rangeControls:- The touch sensitive controls are hit-or-miss. They are very well done and very responsive but the downside is that, it's easy to trigger it unintentionally. If your ear itches or you want to adjust your hair or something else, you can accidentally ""press"" the button by gliding your finger over it. Another issue is when using it when lying down, if any skin (usually earlobes or auricle) glazes over the touch sensitive buttons, your video/song might accicentally pause or if it rests on it for 3 or more seconds, the device can accidentally turn off. But mind you, it's just minor issue and not a delibitating one. I'm just noting it down here for future improvements.Connectivity:- This is one thing I love about these earphones compared to others I have owned. It connects easily with your phone, as well as with the other. For example:- You're using only one of the buds, with the other one in the box; after sometime you want to use both of them, you only have to take it out, it'll turn on and sync itself automatically with the other bud. I'm just mentioning this here because with every other bud I have owned, you need to manually resync both buds everytime.Latency:- This earbuds have a signal latency/delay of 200ms. This is pretty low compared to other earbud and neckbands I have tried out and owned. Latency is a non-issue for basic usage but is a big issue for gamers, and 200ms signal latency is very very forgiveable for games (eg:- codm, pubgm, etc) and this is the most useable earbud/neckband I have used for gaming so far (for the record I have tried out 5-7k inr earbuds that have 500-600ms latency.. and this little guy beats them all). As per my experience, any delay that is at or below 200ms delay is useable/forgiveable for gaming. Anything above 200ms, is useless. Sure, zero latency wired earphones are the best for gaming but given this product comes under 2.5k, have good sound quality and connectivity, the ease of use and quality-of-life thing they offer is a very good compromise for the 200ms delay.Overall:- This is an excellent product for it's price range and I recommend it for basic usage as well as gaming"
"Here is my review of the boat airdopes 441 pro earbuds after using it for two days since purchase.ProsSound quality is good. Balance between the highs and lows with balanced treble and bass.Lightweight.Attractive colors.Good battery backup.ConsCall quality poor, not meant for calls.Finishing not that great, could have been better. For example in the charging case the type c port and usb cable port area. You can tell by looking at the enclosure itself which gives the impression of cheap chinese product, not expected for aesthetic point of view , personally I didn't liked the specifications written in the bottom of the charging case with white color, it destroys the aesthetics of the product.Aptx support not available whereas the same is available in this budget."
"Honest Review After 6 Months of using these TWS.1.The sound quality was okish.Bass was decent  2/5.2.Noise cancellatiom 0/5.3.Build quality is good 4/5.Now coming to the main reason why i rated these tws 1 star was the problem i m facing in these tws rn is after 6 months the right side  earpiece battery gets drained quickly.I tried to call boat customer care no response from them the number is always switched off. If i try to say that i,ll myself come to the boat service center they simply say that it is closed now.This is the excuse they are giving me from the last 15 days everytime i try to complain or ask them for help.I'll never buy any BOAT product in my life.After paying 2.5k for a thing and getting no service is such a terrible thing.Not only this i bought boat stone speaker too same battery issue after charging for 3 hrs it does not even works for 30 mins such a poor quality they are providing to their customers."
Pros1. Good for music. I have had no disconnection on blue tooth during playing music.2. Build quality is good but could be better.3. Bass is ok types not very good but ok.4. Battery life is also good.Cons.1. Frequent disconnection of bluetooth on calls. Suddenly on calls the eardopes go off air. Big time embarrassment when you cannot hear what the other person has said and you end up missing important conversation. This is my return and the same problem persists and I am returning the product second time.2. No volume or noise cancellation.3. Dual mic missing in each eardope so calls are not good. you need to speak too loud so that the other person hears you.Overall above average type of product for music lovers only. Do not buy if you will use it for calls also.
"This works only with Phones - Android/iOS. It connects as a voice/music device to Windows 10, however the microphone output is not working. The headphones are not useful for Windows 10 laptop for calls. It uses Microsoft driver for the headset handsfree handling, and clearly Microsoft is not able to use Boat Airdopes 441.I cannot believe they will ship headphones which don't work with Windows. Get this fixed, sending feedback to them separately as well.Update - On the third windows 10 machine I tried, the microphone works. So your experience will wary. I am not able to make it work with other two machines. Microphone quality is not something to write about, however that is what one would expect at this price point."
"The left ear piece stopped working in just 3 months. The right one was still working .. Poor build quality and quality control, I believe.  I submitted an online service request. The company arranged for courier pick up, repaired/replaced it and shipped it back. It took about one month. They kept me posted about the progress at each step. The process, though slow and steady, worked in the end and now I have working ear pieces.While I am unhappy that it stopped working in 3 months, I am really happy with the warrantly claim and replacement process. Overall good customer service."
I warn you that it will make you cry! This is the best earphone I have listened to and I mean it.Great bass quality 👌. Hell of good vocals.Fits perfectly. Only con is noise cancellation is not that strong. But I don't consider as a problem for me. But do go for this best ones to go for rather than oneplus's earphones.
"These headphones have no compatibility with laptop. Doesn't work at all with laptop. Sometimes you can hear the sound, sometimes you cannot. MIC DOESN'T WORK WITH THE LAPTOP AT ALL. Disappointed by boat. These were my first true wireless headphones and got horrible experience. Will never buy wireless of boat."
"1) The product is not worth it at its current price. I bought it at a price of 1599, which I think was a fair enough deal.The reason it is not a good deal is,2) The charge on the buds stays on for just over 3 hrs of playback as against 5 hrs promised3)The buds occasionally stay connected to the device even when put inside the case, which means they are on inside the case and reduce charging times.4)Does not have noise cancelling.5)Will give you ear pain on prolonged use6)Easily disconnects around corners even when the distance is hardly 2 mtrs7)Irritatingly disconnects and reconnects in certain positions. Sometimes even disconnects in only one bud and reconnects, giving you a horrid experience when listening to music.8)cannot adjust volume using ear buds. You have to use the volume controls on the source to reduce the volume."

"After 10 months and 2 sets of these earphones, I can say with clarity that they are all junk. They work fine for the first three months, then one of the earbuds stops accepting charge. In another 2 months, the other one stops accepting charge. But they never mention this... They just die in 2 minutes each time they need to be used.The pins on the box don't sit properly on the earphones, the lid keeps opening, the earphones drop out of the box relatively easily.. The only thing they are good for, really, is as a powerbank. But, then I'd rather have bought a bigger powerbank.Boat customer support seems nonexistent. No one responds to calls. Third party servicemen hate fixing them because they just break again in 15 days, and no one wants to accept this job.All in all, I've burnt Ra. 5000 on a boat of junk."
"One of the best airpods or air dopes in this segment.Pros: better sound quality in stereo  Excellence BASS sound,  Best battery around 4 hours for music play on single charge and for video or movie 3 and half hours , for call 3 hours,Noise cancellation is good while indore outdore and noisy area it work pretty good.Con's : it too sensitive on touch very quickly or unlikely if u touch through pen also it bill work .I personaly not like this .Conclusion : better option to buy this price around 2k to  2.5 k.it will not disappoint you."
"Good Product as usual. Connectivity is good. But once we switch connectivity from 1 device to another, like I connect to my phone and laptop. If I have to connect back to my phone, need to connect manually. Technically that is correct. Rest all good. Bought it during the sale @around 1800. So value for money. Charging is very good. I only charged 2 or 3 times in two months (I don't use it daily though). Good Product."
"So it's been some days now since I'm using this product, I do recommend it for someone who loves boAt products very much. The case is compact and earbuds cool. The touch quality of the airdopes is something I didn't like very much. By design, they have a cool look and fit very perfectly into the ears. Even the noise cancellation is good. I didn't find the bass quality as promising as mentioned in the description of the product. I got it at 1999 in the Prime Day sale so that's the only part where I find it worth."
"Please don't buy this product. I am writing this review after using it for a month. I am multiple issues with this product.1. Left ear bud stops working after couple of week. (could charging is not happening to this ear bud).2. Even we put ear buds for charging (in charging case) still it doesn't auto switch off.3. Put ear buds in the charging case, still u can listen to the music (if device is already connect and playing music).4. Bluetooth connecton will not be closed when we put it in charging case.5. There is no noice cancellation feature.Just don't with the Boat name or price range. This product is not worth.You can look for other brands for wireless ear buds.I used boat wired earphone, it worked well. I am still using that since 4 years (If I remember correctly).Because of my first good experience with Boat I purchased this.But this is not work buying."
"I already own Sony wh-1000xm3 (since its release) and absolutely love the sound quality on that, but I wanted earpods in order to take work/personal calls (about 2-3 hrs a day). Hence after some amount of research decided to buy this and absolutely pleased with its performance. The call quality is very good, sound levels are good, I can use a single earpod for calls at times. Battery back up is pretty decent (again given the price). I got it during a sale for 1599Rs and at this price you cant go wrong.For Listening to songs, there are better options out there as this is extremely bass heavy!"
"Good ear buds.fits well. Sound quality is good.Cons:- main issue is while we talk on the ,if someone else is around us n if they are even talking normally,then their voice also goes into the mic and opposite person on call can hear that too...In short active noise cancelling is very poor.Rest all , pairing and and sounds are good.To note I have used it with iPhone also and it's works perfectly.iPhone 11 & 11 pro."
I haven't any word for described about seller and boat buds.seller gives me original product with properly package.This ear buds are producing crystal clear sound with extra bass boosting. Noise cancellation also available. For single charge of battery that buds are lasting 4 and half an hours. If you fully charging this box. That box charging 4 times that buds.It is also IPX7 satisfied .The quality of this bud is outstanding. I am giving 5star that seller who gives me original product with best price.I have extremely satisfied over seller. Thanks lot.
"The Product Is really superb really loved it.The Sound quality is really awesome and noise cancellation he is also good but not excellentI didn’t feel any lag while playing videos.The buildup material quality is niceThe Bluetooth connectivity is very smooth and fast.The battery backup was also nice.Call quality is okay. And I feel little heavy for a long time use.Ideal for jogging and gym, it won’t falloff.Good product at this price range. Really worth for 2.5kIf you are a music lover blindly go for it you won’t regret."

"The earbuds are really good. I have been using these for the past 2 weeks and I can say that they are a really good option at this price range.Pros-1. Great build quality2. Great sound quality3. Battery backup is good, lasting around 4-5 hours depending on the volumeCons-1. No noise cancellation2. No customisability for touch controlOverall this is a great product.

For calling its average.Thanks for reading this!!!"
"Was working fine and suddenly the right side went very very low on voice itself , tried all ways but not able to resolve the issueVery disappointed as window to return also closed , trying to find a solutionJan 10th - Writing this review again , after replacing the boat Airdrops from service centre , the airdopes went faulty again on right side after usage of 2 weeks. It seems boat Airdopes have some manufacturing issue which they are not able to solve.  I saw 3 more guys with same issue on service centre , same issue of one ear airdrop going down. Waste of money and effort , better buy Jabra or any brand but not BOAT. Would not recommend it."
"This is overall a great package...I'll rate it 5/5 because i liked its sound quality specially by bass povIts built is awesome and durableIt looks coolCall audio is good can't say the best one but its still goodThe CTC touch is highly sensitive and responsiveI First orderd it and one side of its touch wasn't working properly, it responded only sometimes and the response time was too slow... After 2 days the touch completely gave up i thought it'll eventually recover, but naah it got worse and at last stopped workingI ordered a replacement for that and it is completely functional and working to its max potential...If you want to go deeper into sound quality...It produces the lows and mids nicelyBut the highs are only good when you turn the volume at 80%+ at this point the vocals and highs suppress the bass and at this volume the lows aren't much prominent...But at the same time at 60% which is also known as the sweet spot for most of the TWS earphones they just perform great..The sound doesn't tatters or distorts even at 100% volume but that's too loud...I'll provide a six of five star rating for loudness if it was possibleA must buy product"
"They of very good quality and I have no complain at all. Very good buy. Only thing that after 2 month one earbud start to play low sound. So I ask for service. Let's see how it will be handled by Amazon and Boat. Tomorrow will  be pick up. Otherwise product is supergood. I can use it in the gym and no problems of bud fall of the ear, also I can't hear loud music of the gym, so it's good. I hear only my music. Very good purchase,  advise to everyone."
"Very nice hands free cute airdrops with noise cancellation and highly sensitive mic gives better quality and loudness required for talking calls, casual talks, business meetings, listen to music at gym or on the drive.Very cheap, sweat reflectant and good ergonomics that fits firmly into ear. No heat generated, light weight, easy operations.Charger is excellent ..with beautiful jewel box casing."
"As I was in search of a good budget TWS for a last quiet of months,I ordered boAt 441 Pro on Amazon Prime Day Sale! The previous version was a great success for boat. So,somehow I have a faith working on it. And for my last few gadgets,boAt has not disappointed me at all. So,after a long research and waiting,I got my first TWS.And as a true music and gadget lover,I'll give-4.6/5 for it's Design and Fit.4/5 for it's MUSIC Quality,4.6/5 for it's BASS,3.8/5 for it's Call Quality,4.8/5 for it's Battery life,4.5/5 for it's Touch Quality,4.2/5 for it's Connectivity.So you can definitely go with these pairs of TWS in a budget range of 2500/-  ."
Use it daily on my workouts. Its pairing is amazingly easy & very rarely gets unpaired....other brands have one earphone un pairing at times. Quick to recharge and easy to use. Calls too are a breeze. in windy conditions it acts up a bit..
"Simply outstanding, I can't even describe in words. This earphones has topclass wired like sound effects. My previous earphones which I was using that is Boat Freesoul 511 , which has low sounds volume and very low bass. But this has above my all expectations. I strongly recommend to all specially Bass lovers.Thank you Boat for this amazing product. This month my Birthday is coming."
"Some points based on my experience1. Whenever you connect it to a laptop the volume automatically goes to 100% and if a video is being played at that time then your ears will be toasted, this con is even mentioned on the user manual. I think they are not able to fix a lot of issues because they just rebrand Chinese stuff and sell them in India.2. If you want to take calls on them then this product is not for you, because mic is pathetic and the person who is on call with you cannot hear anything clearly.3. Built quality is decent for a ₹2000 product.Conclusion: I would strongly recommend that you add some extra money and go for a different brand instead of boat, it's really bad."
"It is okay if you use it in stationary, static position with mouth shut throughout. It's definitely not for sports or even walking. You hear the thumping of your foot when walking and it is very disturbing. The fit is just okay but tiring for long use. Another disappointment is that its mic is not recognized by Windows or Zoom. The indicator tones are very confusing, it should have voice guidance. The reset instruction on the leaflet are mentioned differently in two places. Waste of money."
"I bought them sometime back. They worked okay in the beginning, but soon I realised not good with battery backup. The right airdope always runs out of battery much sooner than the left one. Looks faultier. But by the time I realised, it was already past the warranty period. That’s really faulty on sellers terms.The sound quality is okay okay. Not for someone who is an audiophile. Noise cancellation is also average. The rubber pods fail to stick to ear holes and can suddenly pop out. So beware.Overall quality is average only. It’s cost should have been lesser. Something of lesser price can be bought if the quality and usability is to be compromised anyway. Or one should rather add a little more money and buy something worth.PS: I use it with iPhone Xs. For daily usage like online classes it’s just working fine. But again, as there is an issue of slippery,non frictional, non vaccum rubber pod, it tends to pop out. When you adjust it, you mostly end up disconnecting your call. Irritating."
This is a very good wireless earphones for the price......the sound quality may not be that great for some.....that's what you get for this price.....I purchased it for around 1700 when there was festive offer going on....There are a lot people who have complained that one of the ear pods do work.....you will just need to keep the both ear pods back in the case and connect again or reset to fix this.....I went for jogging with these they just don’t fall off....they have such good grip.....they have an extra ear clip grip....tip- choose the default bigger ear clip so that it would fit perfectly in the case...This is made or designed by Indian company....think about the price and try doing some troubleshooting steps mentioned in the manual before leaving bad comments.....
"Bhai log koi word h nahi iske liye to my old earphones and headphones of listening. Experience include focal sense wired,baseus,flame,nokia N70 n95 original,boat basheads,jbl many varients Sony xb55 ap schenizer cx ant audio,bose blutooth earphones of rs around 18k oneaudio,even dz version of one audio,this one just chock slamed all the headphones in terms of sound quality and sound stage.only focal sense is earphones wired which come close to its vocal and dialogue clearty rest all fall back  from this jem.guy just try once you never will buy other earphones once you have it.its complete full stop."
"--=== Update 24 Dec ===I bought Airdope 441pro on 24th October, its been only 2 months period, and I hardly used it for 7-8 times. Now it's right bud drains within 15 minutes and switches off. Registered complaint. Disappointed.---==Update on 31st Dec 2020--===I received wrong replacement product from service center. Worst service by Boat. My product was Airdopes 441pro SPIRIT LIME but they sent me scratchful used old RED airdopes. Again I have registered ticket for replacement. All users plz avoid buying these low quality products.--=== Update 1st Jan 2021Service center closed my ticket without contacting me or giving any resolution. I have again raised complaint. Worst service by BoAt."
"Product is awesomeManufacturing quality is 5 Star ⭐Sound Quality = AmazingBass Quality = Energetic & AwesomeIt fix very easily in my ear & due to it's holder no fear that it will fall..Ah! No doubt , it looks super amazing.It's Charger is but short. So if you have short space charger than must think once..It's touch is amazing! Works smoothRecommended to those who are music / movie lover or buying it for study purpose..Remark After using for 8 months : it's left earbuds battery isn't well, it drains when the other piece has 50% battery left.... Well until 8 months the product worked well.. 🙂🙂"
"I've been using these for nearly a month now, and I am personally very happy with the quality of these Earbuds. The sound cancellation on these is pretty amazing, and I am quite happy with the sound quality as well. Honestly when you get such a good product at this price range, i have no idea why people would spend a bomb more on more expensive products. This is perfectly good. I find the fit rather comfortable as well - took me a day or two to figure out how to wear it properly so it doesnt fall out, but once I got past that, I have had no trouble (you gotta twist it around a little after putting it in). Battery life is awesome as well. Recommend buying without second thought."
"I purchased it a month ago, initially it was awesome but after 10 days it started creating connectivity problem. As return window was closed so I contacted to boat cc where, I simply register a complaint and they replaced my brand new product with already used and repaired one, which is even worst then original. Bluetooth connection gets disturbed even by moving hands around the ears or head itself. Calling experience is very bad, the other person can't listen me properly, eventually I have to remove airdopes. Now I am trying to contact them, they are not responding at all. So people if you are planning to buy it,  then please think before buy it, I will suggest better to move on cheaper bluetooth airdopes rather then investing so much money in such airdopes.Now my update for this issue,I got fresh unit of the same and it is working good."
Hello there...so this is me writing review for airdopes & my very first recommendation is that yes definitely go for this product..it is for sure:Value for moneyGood sound qualityLooks goodComfy in earsOk pretty goodWaterproof :So about this feature..I gotta story to share..all these 3 months I was treating my Airdopes pretty decently but this month I ended up leaving it in my gym shorts pocket & threw it in washing machine 🙄 and only when I realised that it was too late..but hang on once they were getting scrutinised by me assuming that it’s gone & fortunately no it wasn’t gonna die so soon...after a wash sound quality had dimmed for about 15 minutes but then again back to normal..I did that mistake of throwing it again in the washing machine just yesterday too (absent minded me 🙄)..thankfully nothing wrong with them again & it’s goodSo lastly I would say that go ahead & buy them off..👌🏻
"While pairing both the ear buds, one of the mic will work at a time both the mic from the ear bud will not work its not a major problem voice is clear enough for calling purpose. More over the bass is good for the price range while watching movie and songs.There is a lag while picking up the call. While answering a call using touch sensor in the ear bud there is a minor lag for answering,it won't answer after the touch so usually we will touch it again for answering the call but the cal will drop due to multiple touch... I felt this is the only problem for me while attending important calls."
"I get a buzzing sound from the left bud I donno why but overall good experience.Pros: Big battery case, Good bass sometimes over power vocals, build quality, design, touch controls, light weightEdit: started getting transmitter sounds on both the buds.... Worst experience ever cheap quality tws with pathetic Battery life.Cons:Buzzing sound from the left bud quite annoying, slightly heavy case, buds size for small ears isn't that great, no volume control on buds, above avg call quality and mic"
"Bought just minutes after the Prime Day sale started. Already a proud user of Boat airdopes 441 and bought airdopes 441 pro for my brother.The airdopes 441 pro are fully identical with airdopes 441 in terms of sound, bass, quality, feel and size and shape . Only difference is in their charging case, which is of 500mAh in airdopes 441 and 2600mAh in airdopes 441 pro.Go for the pro version only if you get it for 2500 else as airdopes 441 costs only 1999 with no major differences.Pros -Good bass and balanced audio between 65-75% volume.Extra sensitive touch controls.Very good passive noise cancellation.Good calling quality.Cons -It hurts sometimes because of the fin shaped rubber (I dont know if the problem is with everyone because fitting is different for everyone as everyone's ears are of different shape)Sometime when watching youtube videos, the left earbud produces static noise and the right one gives the video sound. It only happened with old youtube videos, on watching recent videos I didn't came across this issue.Vocals are on little low side when listening below 60%Final verdict - If you're looking for any good TWS under 5k then nothing is better than airdopes 441 and 441 pro.Go for it without any second thoughts."
"On the positive side, Guess this is the only ear pod with type c charger in this price band. On the negative side, too much bass which makes your ears tired soon. It fits pretty well on my ears and overall performance is really superb for this price. The Capacitive Touch is too sensitive, it took couple for me to get used to, especially when you try to wear while answering a call. There are two problems i faced (i) few second lag in connection as soon as you answer a call but stabilizes after that. (ii) often the right earbud volume level goes too low and have to factory reset to normalize.  Otherwise, i really low this product"
tws is goood but ----its not waterproof..fake company claim.. duality in wordseveryone cares about sound quality bass...etc...but if any tws has weak lifespan then simply it does not worth it...because remember once its battery is dead its nothing but pebbleso im a regular person who invested 3k in a earphone...i will give my ultimate review atleast 1.5 years laterit is working fine till today...lets see about future days
Boat Airdopes 441It's a true wireless earphones at price range of 2.5 k under this segment there are some competetors which are not so good .Boat  is the company known for its crystal clear sound I have been using Boat rockers for almost 1.5 years so I tried to switch on this segment.So here are pros and cons about the product .Pros:1.The built quality is extremely good2. The sound output is as expected and has deep base and high tones and low tones can be addressed easily3. The carrying case is good and has mangetic holding capability so it enaures true safety and prevents from falling airdopes .4. On an average it gives backup of 25+ hours and each dopes given you utmost 4.5 hours of battery backup once charge .5. It takes 45 min to get compeletely charge6.CTC works well and has hapetic feedback.7. Asthetically it looks good and premium also ergonomically designed for good comfort.8. It doesn't fall while you are running or gyming9.Call quality is good10.It feels good to see the utility and ease to carry your earphonesCons:1. The in ear rings can cause pain in your ear if you wear for long time .2. noise cancellation is good but not best .3. You cannot control volume on this .
"At this cost (2.5k) its quite decent bluetooth headphones. The bass is not that deep but quite impactfull. The lows and mids are impressive, the volume is low Unless you manually increase it from your device. The case is made of average plastic and holds up well. The battery life is brilliant and as they claim you can actually charge your phone with it if it's an emergency. Overall a decent product from Boat. If you are looking for a bwtger sound quality then I would recommend to increase budget and go for a JBL or sony, but if you are looking for TWS headphones under 3k this one does its job. Cheers"
"I like the pod's sound overall but it is a bit bass-heavy for me (I am a mixing engineer so I guess I'm just used to flat response headphones). I love the noise cancellation when I'm listening to audiobooks or just sitting in for a writing session. For me, I was surprised by their customer care. The pods stopped working after 15 days, I thought there goes my money down the drain. BoaAt customer care was excellent best service I have ever had from an Indian electronics company hands down."
"Sound quality and bass quality is really good. Of course its boat and you can't deny it. Comes with type-c charging port which is really awesome. Compact and duration of the headphones is realy good. I can use upto 3-4 hrsBut I'm really disappointed with the noise cancellation.It's pathetic.ppl on the other sided can even the voice of the vehicle going in the road, if I'm sitting inside my house. It could have been better."
"Just what is needed for the price, I was lucky enough to get it with a lightening deal.The audio clarity is excellent. The playback hours are really good. I could wear them for a long time without any ear pain or irritation. One wierd thing is that one of the ear buds loses power quicker than others, i guess that's because it's the primary. But recharges quickly and you are back on. So far the best ear buds for the price. Really worth it."
"The way the bus penetrate in the ears will leave you in pain after sometime..you cannot wear it for a longer time .. the ear starts paining, moreover on wearing it you cannot hear anything from outside which makes it very dangerous  - you kind a get a continuous hollow noise in your ears, so even while talking to someone normally in person, your voices echoes to yourself... had worn it for the 1st week, now have kept it aside, can be helpful only during driving for a while.Ps - the opposite person doesn't hears our voice comfortably, so you end up speaking loudly.. buy ultimately that's what you can expect for its price"
"I rec product yest as i m an audiophile and considering the price bracket this product is worth of its price i compared a lott many and reviewed many products including soundcore lite real me ,redmi ear buds etc in orice range of less tan 3000. Sound is not that very loud that it will hurt ur ears u can easily tolerate on full volume,sound clarity is uoto the mark bass is ootimal to my liking not like thumpimg but pleasure to hear,best part is its mic quality i usually dnt hve ti use in travell but while in a room or working place no issues wid mic and sound quality on call ,connectiom is good iwp working well fitting is perfrct change silicon cover acc to ur fit so it sounds best as it seals completely build quality is too notch stil hve to notice hw much it runs in a single charge wil update soon but wid a brand warranty better not to opt for otr local product can eaily go wid this ear pods!!"
"I have been using it for 5-6 months:Important Points:1) Quality bass for an airpod with really good lows! I really enjoyed every beat.2) Although looks bulky, fits into the ear like a charm. Doesn't fall off unless you hit your ear! Strong plastic build.3) Connectivity is really nice. Happens without a delay.4) LEDs are too attention drawing. Expected some way to control them but there ain't any!5) Battery back up was really good at the beginning but gradually dropped over time. After 5 months, 3.5 hour backup reduced to 30 min.- I have applied for warranty, lets see. Imagine Marketing has a very bad reputation for warranty claims (even their customer care isn't reachable). I had a very bad experience with them last time with my Rockerz 255! I will go up to 4 or 5 stars if they replace my unit!"
Overall I really liked the product based on below observations after a week time of usage1. Mainly bought to use while running. Fits perfect and never fell down during my course of 10km run.2. Sound Quality is good3. Bass Quality is good4. Touch option is very responsive but it will take bit of time for you to get used to it5. Very compact (Refer attaches photo)6. Build quality is good7. Battery lasts longer8. Bought for a deal of 2k during prime day sale9. Overall completely satisfied (so rated 5 star)
"This airdopes is just amazing for its price. Superb comfort. Love the design. The case is itself a powerbank. Stunning battery backup. Sound quality is so crisp and clear. It's not a noise cancelling earphone but while I'm listening to music or watching a movie, there's definitely no background noise that gets through. The bass quality is also fantastic. It pairs so seamlessly with my phone. Absolute value for money product. I'm writing this review after using it for 8 months. I've had 0 issues so far. Love boat. It's just too too good. I would suggest this product to everyone. I wish there was a better rating i could give. Thank you for making such an awesome product."
Didn't expect such a great sound experience will get from Boat earbuds.... Awesome sound clearity....heavy bass which I loved more.....good call clearity....overall very satisfied with the performance......Thanks Amazon for the quick and fast delivery service....👍👍
"Good quality earphones.... good sound and good battery backup... you have to get used to the touch sensors as it often turns on and off while putting them on or taking off. The large battery capacity for of the case makes a huge difference, I don't charge mine for a week or more! I only wish it had slightly lower and tighter bass, rest all great! Pairing is a breeze.... and works good for long hours..."
"It has some connectivity issue... The touch pad doesn't work.. buds doesn't get connected with Bluetooth automatically.. and while connecting it shows error most of the times..I bought this product because I have bought the same airdopes last year and it came out perfect..But I guess this ""masaba"" edition has this problem that I am facing..If you want to buy the boat airdopes I would suggest you to go for the original one and not for such colour themed edition, because it gives you various vibrant designs to choose but the quality is not up to the mark.. simple ones are good."
"Writing the review after two weeks of usage.Opted for boat airdopes 441 after a lot of scrutiny and comparison. On paper this is one of the best airpods for the price. Bang for the buck. Glad to say that it didn't disappoint one bit. The sound quality is too good. All notes are clear. The bass at times are too high but most of the times it’s perfect. Not as good as JBL but again keeping the price in mind, it’s worth it. One thing that shocked me was the treble these dopes provided. Absolutely sickening. Imo these are in par with the expensive airpods out there in terms of the treble. They have passive noise canceling and it’s pretty good.Talking about the fit now; I’ve worn a lot of earphones, from samsung to one plus to apple. All of them fit good. But this? This fit perfectly. Exact tightness. If you don’t like the ear pads, boat has provided a couple other sizes too. One of them ought to fit you. These snuggle up so well in my ears that even heavy movement running drills and jump rope fail to trip them out. Absolutely loved it. They’re IP67 rated so sweat us no issue.Now the connectivity; So far everything’s been smooth. I use an iOS. After initial connection it pairs up automatically every time you open and clip it in your ear. IWP.Battery; Battery backup so far is almost what they say on paper. A total of 30 hours playback time. Haven’t tested it for 30 but I’ve used it for long enough. It’s safe to say that it’ll get you through a day usage with one charge cycle.Call; I won’t suggest call on mono mode (only one airdope). But when both are clipped in your ear there’s no trouble and it’s pretty clear. Also a big no to using it for calling purposes in noisy environments.The only problem with these are regarding the capacitive touch. Don’t get me wrong it works fabulously. It’s just that it is way too sensitive. The slightest touch can work the functions. And sometimes I’ve noticed that when my sweat touches it too. But that’s definitely not a very troubling point. Just put it out here.All in all if you’re looking for a good budget wireless earphones with good sound quality and minimal flaws, then the boat 441 is the go to. Hope I helped you decide. Whether to buy or not."
"Good sound quality, doesnt fit comfirtably into ears..cant use for long time( >2hrs), i was attending professional video sessions which last for 3-4hrs at a stretch..after 1 hr i started to feel dyscomfort n had to remove them after 2hrs..they were sort of hurting and not very easy on ears.Ptron bass airdopes are cheaper and soft to wear, i bought ptron bass for my mom n they are Good. Boat aidopes cost more and less comfort., but if it is for use less than an hour they are good."
"After one day usage-------------------------So far so good.Pros :1. Audio Quality2. Noise cancellation3. Battery backup4. Easy usageCons:1. Volume adjustmants could have provided with long pressOverall, first of all big thanks to big 2600mah case,Excellent airdopes in this budget.Single pod usage also there , who want to use continuesly for the day without charging case can use one bud at a time so that other will be in 100% charging when the first one was drying.Also , we can switch off the buds when not necessary which was not available in competitors.Good bass.. good sound quality.I like it till now. Will update after 10days usage"
Its an awesome TWS device. Go for Boat Airdopes 441. I bought it for Rs. 2499. Today I recieved them and they are absolutely awesome. I called my friends and they told they were able to hear me clearly And need not mention I was perfectly able to hear them. The 6mm drivers are perfect and the songs sound quality is awesome. The bass is punchy. They are a perfect buy for a bass lover and someone looking for a budget friendly TWS. I was in doubt about calling feature reading other reviews but I have faced no issues as such.
"This is a piece of crap. The earphones doesn't fits well and kept on falling no matter which buds you use, even with smallest buds, you get pain in your ears. All that was still fine, but the touch sensor is a bane instead of a boon. The touch sensor gets the call disconnected even if a strand of hair accidently touches it. Its frustrating to get official calls disconnected in the middle of some important discussion cz of the dumb touch sesor. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY TO BUY"
"Been using it for a month now ...Sound output is good for basic use - as in listening to music, watching videos and attending calls.There's almost no time lag in connecting to the phone.Range is around 15 - 20 feet indoors. Connection breaks if distance from device is more than this.I have charged the case just once after receiving the product. I use the dopes almost everyday for at least 2 hours. The indicator on the case still shows 50% charge.Build is sturdy.If the music has too much bass, it gets a little harsh on the ears. The buzz if the bass masks most of the other music, but this is only if played on full volume. So I feel it isn't a great choice for people into heavy metal, and even for those who listen to other loud music.Though made in China, Indian brand - another small factor I considered while buying.Overall, I'd say a decent option in said price range."
I am using  this airdrops since  last 3 or 4 months  and it hasn't  showed me any problems. Its battery  is good its last upto 4 to 5 hours in a single  charge and the case can last upto 1 and half day i actually  don't  know  about case because  its never have got dead or kind of because  i charge  its when  i use the case for 2 3 times..so if you spoil your wired earphones  in only some days you should  go for it...
"sound quality, battery back up are really very good, but noise cancellation is very poor, need to talk loudly when wearing it.Pros:1.automatically connects when you open charging case, fast speed2. Base is awesome, better than wired ones3. Battery back up of buds is nearly 6 to 7 hrs while in music n calls & For charging case 2 to 3 days, takes 2 to 3 hrs for full charging4. Touch sensitivity is so good, just click n goCons:1. Noise cancellation is very poor, voice will not be clear when in public,you have to speak somewhat loudly else voice is not enough to other listener,if somebody talking besides you, that person voice catches easily, as earpiece mic is in ear.2. Buds gives light pain due to its different size"
"Being very much trusted and popular brand, boat has always kept our expectations high. But this time i am very very much disappointed.The 'boat airdopes 441' are mearly working properly, on call it automatically disconnects after 20-30 seconds. After taking out the airdopes from its case many time only one airdope is switched on and other is off. Bedside that it has a very less noise cancellation, I have exchanged it but the second one has also the same condition🙁I am heavily recemending 𝙥𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙚 𝙙𝙤𝙣'𝙩 𝙗𝙮𝙚."
There is a constant buzzing sound on the left earbud alone.
"I got this product yesterday and in my first call itself my friend said he is not able to hear me clearly.The mic works but poor. My 2 yrs old Bluetooth headphone works much better than this.Sound quality is OK. If you have already used good headphones earlier, you will be disappointed.Suggestion:Don't buy this, If you are looking to purchase for calls.Don't buy this, if you are a music lover and looking for good sound quality with bass.Buy this, if you don't mind paying for overpriced item with not so standard sound quality.Honestly, buying this product disappointed me."
"Got these in November 2020. Loved them initially, but could never wear them for long periods. One of them had low volume issues soon, and then it stopped charging properly in the case. Boat was nice enough to collect it from my home, took 3-4weeks to repair it and sent it back to me at no extra cost. So now I have repaired buds that still have charging issues from time to time. The sound is okay, but the pain in the ear is bad, and so is the mic quality. I have taken off the wing tips a long time ago, and tried different tips for less pain, but nothing works.To give you context, the Sennheiser wired earbuds with the small tips are the most comfortable for me. Maybe that's just my ears."
"The product is definitely good looking. It's compact and feels great on ears. But it's the case that was a tad disappointing. Felt too plastic and feable, as if long term usage can break it.It pairs very quickly and the touch is super sensitive, which is a good thing Ince you learn the tap gestures.Music feels great, it's well balanced and gives a good kick at this price point. But being a bass lover, felt bass is bit on the lower side.Now, finally the call quality. I didn't like the call quality at all. The person at the other end was finding my voice broken and feable. It also seemed that I am speaking from distance with lot of environment noise around me.This made me return it. But, if l calling isn't your concern. I would suggest getting it at 2500. A good deal."
"Pros:- Works as advertised for the most part- Light on the ears- Reliable, good sound quality- Mobile call quality seems decent (other side is not complaining)- Pairs quicklyCons- Very touch sensitive - tends to cut off calls even if we touch it by mistake, so one needs to be careful while wearing it- Sometimes I am having audio quality issues. It is choppy- Distance range is not very long. If I walk around or just step outside the room audio quality drops"
"I bought this after reading the reviews from several other Users. And I must say thank you for those reviews !!I am writing a review on this product myself. I found the product very convenient to use without much setup or configuration. It is as easy as open and pull out out the pods and just latch it on into the ears. Fits perfectly and does not fall off even on a sneeze :)The bluetooth reception is fairly good to about more than 10m. The voice quality on the mic and sounds in the pods are just amazing. I have been using this for about a week now and have used it for my office meetings, video calls, movies, radio, phone calls and it just works amazing on all applications.Today is the 10th day after having charged it once when i bought the device, and haven't had the need to charge even now, it keeps going on. One thing that i observed is place the pods into the holder after each use, that helps the pods to sync up and charge up for the next use.Good one for a gift and value for the money. I have used boAt products earlier too and I have had the best experience with it!!"
"Sound quality: It is rich and crispy ,no distortionsBass:Punchy basscalls: In mobile-3/5 not best but okay sometimes opp person cant hear u  In Laptop: Echoes in meeting calls , most of the time person cant here you and will complain low voicefit to ears: yes u can have it on jog/workout no problemWith higher volume bass is too heavy, i got headache after using sometimebattery backup is goodWith existing buds i felt really uncomfortable and after changing with other buds which i got as extra it is ok now takes time to get comfortness.Connects very fast with mobile (automatically)but lapy u need to connect manuallylooks are premiumi guess i covered allNote: Those who are looking for calls pls dont go for it.you might feel iritation"
"Purchased it during the Great Indian Sale.Pros -Price point.Good Treble.Decent clarity in audio.Mic is decent for voice/video calls.Cons -Very moderator volume.No Bass.Audio is too low during voice/video calls.Badly thought design - you can’t lie down or wear this while sleeping. The moment the outer side touches the pillow or even a cloth it will turn off. It is irritating.Overall, it is an ok product at the price point. If you are looking for awesome audio quality, bass and battery life then please go for a product that is priced above 8000. If it is just for casual listening then this is perfect for you."
"The looks of this airdopes is nice. it feels little bulky on ear but its manageable. I want red one which looks awesome but ordered yellow since it was cheaper.Sound wise it is descent, initially I was worried about the sound quality but after setting up the equalizer it sounds near perfect, bass is good. I was using top range wired earphones before this and obviously it is not up to that quality. But as TWS, this is my first pair and pretty much satisfied with it.case quality is good, range (10 steps) and battery (last 3 days with medium use) is also nice. I got these in 2K with and offer. If you get the same deal than go for it."
"First all i would like to mention that it is a very good wireless earbuds @1999rs.When u put these airdopes in your ear for the first time u feel wierd because of whole covering the year for noise cancelation. But you get used it. Noise Cancellation also works pretty good. The Sound quality of these airdopes are good. And mind, These Earbuds have much extra bass compared to others. so for high bass lovers these are good. And if u dont like bass, dont go for it. Insta wake up and pair feature goes completeley good everytime. The touch controls are also good with high sensitivity. Charge also remains for good hours both with case and without. And If u buy these for only Gaming purpose, u feel a bit of latency which is common for all wireless earbuds. The Case is small and convenient. The earbuds get into the case smoothly with magnetic power most of times except a few times. I would suggest you this airdopes which are very good at the rate If u like extra bass and for music lovers. And if u are a big gamer who doesnt like even a bit of latency and if u dont like uch bass then u may go for other."
"Good product for the price tag, bought this around March 2021 around 1.9k, the features are good (noise cancelling, bass etc) it's drop resistance is good as wellCons. Battery is really bad now after a year the charge does not stay longer than 30 mins when in usage (music, games) for phone calls it switches off in 15 mins😑 only good thing is that the mono usage so I keep swapping the earphones in and out of the case.Cheers."
"Do not buy!-Charging issue you will face (something in one ear or both)-chances of falling and never seeing it again are more😬(think about travelling, sitting near pool/lake, wearing and removing mask/scarf/helmet etc)-Audio disturbance-poor voice clearity while attending calls-does'nt connect with two devices simultaneously via bluetooth ( i.e you need to disconnect the 1st device to connect with 2nd device)-earbuds charging box is not scratch prof😬 (also for white shade charging box is too 🌟🌟stary-stary🌟🌟😬)"
"Nothing fancy about these.Noise cancellation is alright. Used them while riding my bike and could faintly hear traffic noise. Not bad if you concentrate on listening music etc instead of traffic noise.Bass is a bit heavy considering you have to keep the volume of these above 60% for a good listen. Yeah you can't hear anything properly if you keep volume below 60% even in an noise free place.Battery life is a bit of a concern for me. barely lasts 3+ hours and somehow one earbud drained all of its battery while the other still had juice left, even though i charged them when i got them and never used only one of them separately.Case is good but i fear i might rip the top lid off cuz it feels very delicate for some reason. Has usb C so thats a plus.They maybe a pain if you listen to them for a while, i mean they fit good but you'll have to keep removing them for a minute or two to relive the pain once in a while. This obviously will vary person to person.Overall, as i said, they are good enough to be your first TWS earbuds. Go for it if 3k is your budget and you like bass."
"Totally Awesome Product* Sound Quality 5/5* Build Quality 4.5/5* Charge Backup 5/5* Charging Speed 5/5The Product fits perfectly, it doesn't fall off, The only demerit (in a way) due to noise cancellation you cant hear anything, even if you don't play music your hearing will be educed by 50% when wearing the ear buds"
"Review from 21 Dec 2020 (After 4 Months ) :I was skeptical in getting these earbuds but after a lot of comparing and watching a lot of YouTube videos, I finally got them and it exceeded my expectations. The main thing which I would like to highlight are its Bass and Battery life as they both are pretty amazing for its price of 2k. I hugely recommend these airdopes if you are a Bass head.The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement fold able pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.Okay now to its detailed pros and cons:-Sound Review 🔊 :- 4.8/51.Amazing Bass ( 100% for music Bass lovers). The bass is literally amazing. 100% RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE A BASS HEAD OR A MUSIC LOVER!!!2.True Wireless Stereo (TWS) works as expected connection time in matter of 1 second.3.At the initial pair it is set to 100% volume but in the next TWS it will recognize the previous setting and adjust.4.Sweet spot of volume would be at 60 or 70 %. (FYI, I felt best bass is at 70% though and the next point will tell you why not to cross after 70% outside on the road)5.After 70% its literally impossible to hear anything around oneself even if someone is yelling at the user face to face. No joke!! As the bass and the volume increases and the noise cancellation is more affective.Battery review 🔋  :- 4.5/51.Earbuds without the case:- 5 to 6 hours2.Earbuds with Case:- 3 or 4 days max (As per my usual usage )3.The case charges from 0 to 100 in 1.5 hours and the Airdopes takes about an hour or less.4.The buds can be used 4-5 times a day.5.At 60% volume the buds can stay up to 5 hours max.6.At 90% or above volume the buds can stay up to 4.5 hours max.7.As it reaches 10% it starts notifying low battery.8.The case turns its indicator to purple if its below 10% or 20%.Case Body, Range, Lag/Latency etc. 🎮🎶📞 :- (Durability - 4.8/5)1.Works well in 10 meter radius as advertised provided that nothing is obstructing between the Airdopes and the device its connected to.2.The case is pretty strong. Even if its dropped down to the floor nothing can happen.[ NOTE:- The case has a magnetic lid and it can open up, depending upon the impact the buds can fall out of its magnetic hold inside the case and the itself. I can ensure that no damage occurred other than few scratches of over time use ]. So for that, overall Durability Test A+.3.The case lid also has a magnetic lid which is strong unless if u drop it more than half a meter.4.There was no lag at all while playing multiplayer games like Apex, CODM, COD Warfare, Star Wars Battlefront II, etc. Footsteps can be a little hard to hear but its fine honestly its little less audible than my Sennheiser CX 180 and its hard to notice as thats not much of a difference.5.Calling features works well with good clarity in a noiseless environment as there is any noise in the background the mic from the earbud will pick it up. Lets say it does its job.6.The buds have touch buttons for its media/call purposes respectively.  a)Single touch on either side to start playing song.  b)Double tab on right to skip to next song.  c)Double tab on left to previous song.  d)Long press for 2 seconds on either side for Assistant.  e)Long press more than 2 seconds on either side for turning off that particular side earbud.  f)Single tap to accept the call.  g)IF the call is going on then single tap again to cut the call.  h)Double tap to reject call.7.The capacitive touch is so sensitive that it works with watery hands, cloth touch, rubber, gloves etc.8.The ear hooks can take sometime to getting used to until you find the prefect fit it will keep coming out of the ear. So wear the correct rubber fittings and ear hooks which is for your ear.9.After long periods of usage (more than 6 hours) the buds can start coming lose as it loses its grip but this depends from person to person.10.Haven't tested the water drop test yet but its splash proof guaranteed and has IPx7 rating.11.I usually use them at night when I go to sleep and next day morning I may be sleeping on it and nothing happens to it."
"I love the product however from 10 Jan 2022, there was an issue that when  I was speaking hile connecting the product the other side person not able to hear. I raised a complaint however in current situation, where  covid 19 cases are increasing and I have blessed triplets recently. So I would not able to visit the service centre.Hence I would request you to replace the product on special case then it would be really appreciated. Looking forward to hear your kind response. Thank you."

"After using it for a month,I have the following observations:Pros1.Bass quality is very good and punchy.2.Battery life is good .It easily lasts for 4-5 hrs on single use.As for the case I need to charge it once in 7-8 days . Case is also sleek and acceptable size and fits into any trouser pocket easily.3. Connectivity is one of the biggest plus points.Its IWP function really works like a charm. There is absolutely no lag in connection once u take out the earbuds from the case4.Fit and comfortability is excellent..U can wear it for 2-3 hrs at a stretch without any discomfort or pain in ears. After that it might get a bit uncomfortable,but I guess that's the case with almost all the TWS earbuds available in the marketCons:1.Call quality is ok in quiet environment..but in crowded places it is very poor. I have to remove the earbuds and speak directly over the phone when I'm im travelling.2 .Noise cancellation is only passive,not active3. Sometimes one of the earbuds stops working when u remove it from your ear even for a few seconds.But the problem is immediately rectified when u put both the earbuds in the case,close it and take them out againOverall a good buy, considering the price range. I would recommend these earbuds for their decent sound quality,good battery life , and ultra fast connectivity."
"Well It's been 2 days since I've been using them and I would say these are a pretty decent pair of earbuds.Starting off with sound quality, it's amazing... while ordering them I thought since they have just 6mm drivers, there loudness might be low but that's not the case here. I compared them with OnePlus bullets and boat rockerz 255 pro and they beat OnePlus ones and stand at same level with rockerz. Bass is nice, trebles are good, overall 4.5/5 for sound.Connectivity- it's super fast. As soon as you open them they connect automatically to previously connected device in 1-3 seconds.Coming to comfort- I'm disappointed. They give such a strong grip that they started pain in my ears after 5-10 minutes of usage. I was not able to use them for even 30-40 minutes. Now the thing is everyone's ear size is different so I can't say how will they fit on you but for mine they are super tight in medium size and loose in large ones. After trying to diagnose the issue, I found out that the part in my ears where the wings of the buds fit to provide grip is not so big (i.e. my ears are not big enough though I'm 18) because of that they were paining a lot. So if you have small space above your ear canal then you will also feel the same issue like me. In the end had to return them, I felt bad as they sounded amazing but they were tight.Overall they have amazing sound quality but not so good comfort (at least for me) . If you are okay with it, you can go with them else look for something elseThank you !"
"One star for Build quality, One star for sound quality.Cons:1. Bluetooth connection with mobile is good, but for PC or Mac really bad. I need to change the Headset for call and Song each time.2. The touch sensitivity is too much, I can't adjust the ear buds without touching it. Either does a play/pause or connects call.3. Definitely not 150 hours charge backup. Also 5 hours charge for headphones is not working. I need to charge it between 2 to 3 hours gap.4. Bass seems over high."
"When I opened the ordered parcel, the box was not sealed with polythene, sound quality and performance of the Airdopes were unsatisfactory. I carefully observed the box and found scratches on the Airdopes. Immediately I was convinced that used item was handed over to me. I rejected the same and replacement was sent by vendor. This time it was quite OK. It was sealed with polythene all around the box and on opening the box Airdopes and case was in good condition.Now, regarding the sound quality, it is satisfactory, the product is very good, but in lesser price range Real Me is offering Airdopes and its performance is nonetheless inferior to BoAt."
Pros..............• Great sound• Awesome bass• High sensitive touch controls• Killer looks• Nice fitting good for (Gym/jogging/exercise)• Sufficient battery 3h-4h at 100% volume• Mic is ok• Mono pairing & Stereo pairing• boAt's 1 year fantastic service supportCons..............• Little bit delay noticed while gaming not for watching movies or videos• Only supports SBC (but it's ok for me)
"First of all thanks Amazon for a super fast delivery.According to me go for the spirit lime colour it's more attractiveThe sound quality is Awesome.The bass quality is Fabulous.I am very much impressed with the noise cancellation.The biggest thing is the battery backup, I am hearing it for 3 days on full charge and the case still has 50% battery left.The case is super compact and small in size so no issue.The build quality is Amazing and it fits perfectly in ear and after wearing it for long time also ,there will be no pain in your ear and no chance of falling down."
Good sound quality with bass . Connecting with mobile phone is not a problem but when connected to laptop I am facing too much trouble. Both are playing but in between one side gets unconnected i don't know why?🤷 If anyone knows the solution kindly reply me
"First the best part-Have used it for almost a month now majorly to watch movies on my phone (One Plus 8Pro) battery life is good on the ear dopes & very good on charging case.....Eardopes fit well in the ears......Drawbacks are that the volume level and bass level could have been higher......also a bit more on voice clarity would do wonders.....Overall it a good buy for gaming,watching videos,movies and for calls.....Wanted to give 4-1/2 stars only and only if sound volume and bass was..... let’s say 3-4 levels more......Then this would be the BEST BUY even compared for airdopes which are priced at 10,000 to13,999 Rs"
"Earbuds have the HD sound clarity , voice calling is low voice, bass , design, touch control is okay not excellent, .....my first truly wireless approx 1999 Rs.Sound clarity 8/10HD sound 8/10Design 7/10Touch control 6/10Ear fit 8/10Noise cancellation 5/10Bass 6/10Battery  earbuds & charging case both  9/10Also got few ear caps.Edit 1.... review after 6 months..... touch control is not so good.....Mic is worst....other person cannot hear your voice...instead of this buy neckband.Edit 2..... review after 12months Airdopes started showing issue on one of the side ... left side not working properly..... volume became very low.... service center didn't help in this matter... they just said this problem is common in every Airdopes so didn't replace or repair it even it's in warranty.Over all not up to the mark... it's okay for very light use. not recommended"
"Connection is quick and easy. Sound is good. That is about it. The positives stop there for me.They cannot be used for more than 20 minutes at a stretch. Ears start to pain, perhaps from the radiation. It is not very convenient fit too for longer duration usage. It is absolutely useless for handling calls. I feel this product is extremely over rated."
"Had been using it for a Week since and I absolutely Loved it.Battery life GoodSound Quality Excellent for the Price Range, better than other wired earphones within the range.Does not pain at all while wearing even for long time.Simply without thinking Go for It."
"I have been using this headset for nearly a month now...  As far the sound quality is considered it is pretty good for this rate... The battery drains at the rate of 20% per hour by keeping volume at 50%. Even at 50% , the sound quality is pretty good. While attending calls also it is very good.Overall 5* for this product"
Best sound qualityNice battery lifeGood product
I ordered these about a month ago. At first I received used product from Amazon so had it replaced.Replacement earbuds lasted only for a month. Left earbud couldn't last for more than 20 minutes on full charge. I thought electronics do go bad and that is what warranty is for. So looked it up and they are making me cross almost an entire city and get these to their service center and then I have to do that again to get them back. If it were to have lasted at least for a 6 months then I wouldn't have mind but this is just too much.
"Pros: Sound quality is good. Very bassy.  Battery life is amazing. Feels  premiumCons: After 10 days of use, noticed a slight crackle in the left earbud. So for instance, if you start some video and pause it, there's a significantly audible crackle in the left earbud which is kind of annoyingUpdate (9 months use) : Okay I may have nitpicked in the cons. But these earphones are durable too. I accidentally dropped these in water and sound and bass were gone. Which made me buy realme air buds 2 which has advanced features like ANC and a dedicated software. Suddenly, my airdopes started working. Realme isn't bad but I did not like the transition from airdopes so much. The overall sound quality is so much satisfying on airdopes. I am a bass lover, and these provides authentic bass as compared to a bass boosted mode on the realme, which overshadows other aspects of the song you're listening to. So, I'll say you'll have your money well spent on airdopes. It's cheaper and after all, the sound quality matters."
"Although Airdopes are good, But amazon did false advertising / given false description of the product (like showed ipx7, 25 hours backup etc. but the real configuration was 18 hrs, ipx6) in display page. As I saw  ipx7, 25 hours in description, I had purchased these airdopes.I feel deceived by Amazon, as you did false advertising of the product. The features were nothing compared to the advertised product. In shortGood featuresPurchasedWhen deliveredProduct description Page changed to the original lower features."
"I've used the Icon X earpods from Samsung for a few months which is worth 13,500 and trust me for this price range this performs better than the Icon X . Specially the calls are way better than the Icon X . For Music its anytime advisable . It's not just an affordable earpods it's also one of the best in the market which can perform equal to or even defeat the ones which worth 10 times of this earpods. Excellent Prooduct. Go for it .Battery again is excellent . East to handle . Tiny case makes it easy ."
This earbud dint even work for more than a month. Was super while it lasted but after that it stoped working. One of the charging buds dint work an so the earbuds isn’t charge at all. Always says power low even after keeping in charge for long time. I raised complaint and they gave replacement and that also same issue..got bored asking for replacements and can’t waste my time on this.Would spend money on something which is of good quality and long lasting than this.
"I bought this product during the Prime day launch. .Got this product after reviewing and seeing its older version on youtube. It is fantastic product and it is my first TWS and its working good in my Iphone 11 with siri with a tap.The size of airbud flawlessly goes into your ears and perfect for home gym workouts.I chose red product. Since, i own Iphone 11 red.  Its sounds and noise cancellation are awesome.I am posting this review after 2 days usage. Backup and Case with inbuilt Powerbank of 2600 mah with the price.Only thing , which is missing is wireless charging. If they gave it next edition in boAt airpodes that would be great."
"I bought this in Prime Day sale and honestly speaking this is one of the best deals ever.Sound quality is awesome. Bass is so good that I don't hesitate comparing it with Bose TWS that costs around 18k.People going around saying that it doesn't have noise cancellation. Well yes you can say it doesn't cancel out the noise when you're talking to someone on calls and the other person can hear your background noise on the other side of the call (but that thing is acceptable because it happens in the case of bare naked phones too)but when you are listening to songs, I must tell you it doesn't let you hear whatever is going on the outside. Moreover, when you put on these buds, it already cancels out 50% of the noise whatever is going on around you.It has a massive battery backup (yeah that's why they're taking 1k more than the normal version)The only shortcoming I found was, in low volume (less than 40% vol) the songs feel empty(I mean it doesn't give much bass and the treble is also low, the sound is flat) but hey who's gonna keep the volume low, right? Turn it up to 60% and there you go! feel the nirvana !"
If you are buying this to attend calls please do not buyYou will end up repeating every thing to the the other end and end up removing and talking directly into your phoneGood for musicBut this close your whole ear and you end up hearing nothing when it’s in your earNot suggested
"Excellent quality and build,t hose who complain.....what else do you expect at this price....a carbon fibre case!!!Overall nice build, ofcourse the bass is low and the volume also seems a bit less in comparision with around the neck or over the ear headphones......for watching video lectures and stuff....this is the best....calling quality is acceptable unless you talk for hours in a day."
"Only been a day since I bought. Will be updating it after further use.I've added pictures to show the different sizes of buds packed along with it (as well a pair of fins of slightly different shape).Once I got the right buds fitted to them they are conformable to wear, even for long durations and they do not pop out either. I even went cycling for a few km, the buds held.Pros:4 sets of silicone tips and 2 pairs of fins provided in total.ComfortableGood fitIWP (instant wake n pair, the buds connect to the last connected device as soon as the lid is raised)Capacitive touch (pause/play, next/prev, accept/reject calls, Google assistant/siri)They look cool.BASS- OK the bass is really good. Also my phone has built in audio enhancement by Dolby, that makes it even better. Best this price can give you.Mono/stereo- u can use 1 bud at a time too. Noise cancellation: with the right tip, the ear is completely plugged.ConsCalls- the person u r speaking to, will hear a lot of your background noise. If using for calling purposes, try to avoid sitting under a fan and stay indoors.Internal noise-not exactly a con. This is a problem with every noise cancelling earphones / IEMs. With external noise subdued, internal sounds like blood rushing and footsteps are enhanced. You will get used to it.Volume controls - volume can't be controlled.Connectivity-claims to be BT v 5.0 but cannot connect to multiple devices at once.Also, you can't change the track being played only if one bud is connected.If I face any issues, I'll update."
"Writting review after 15days. I am just going to mention what I liked and disliked here.Liked-1.Battery backup is really good. Goes till 10 hours with 100%.2. The sound quality is great,you really get good experience while binge watching.3. Handsdown on noice cancellation. Better than any other pods.Disliked-1. Connectivity issue. While watching sometime bluetooth gets disconnected automatically. And one of the pods doesn't gets paired at times. Which i find very annoying.2. Its bit painful in the ear after wearing for longer time.But overall I think its a decent buy for those who wants to experience pods. And wants to invest money in something good."
"Pros1. Better Sound Quality2. Good enough Bass3. TWS (True Wireless Stereo) with IWP (Insta Wake and Pair) works fine4. IPX7Cons1. No ANC - Active Noise Cancellation2. It's a pain in the EAR (personal experience)3. Sometimes only one earbud gets paired, so you need to put them back in the box and open again (typical Indian booting concept 😄)4. You don't get any RETURN option from Amazon, although you get a REPLACEMENT option but the window is open for only 7-10 days from the date of purchaseSo what should you do then?1. Choose the brand wisely2. If you like boAt (like ME😜), then go for 281 in the same price range3. Choose the shape of your earbuds carefully4. If TWS doesn't matter to you, then go for OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition which is a in-Ear Bluetooth Earphone5. If Bluetooth doesn't matter to you then go either for JBL C200SI or boAt BassHeads 225/100"
"You must know what you want and what you get at this price... it's not the best sound quality, obviously. But do you need that? If you do, take a gamble, spend 10k online and buy a branded pair. But if your use is just listening to music (like ordinary people, rather than going on and on about bass and high notes and God knows what), listening to podcasts or audio books, think no further, buy it. There is that hum in one of the buds, not constantly but it's there. This has been very useful for me and I'd recommend it to anyone."
"Work as expected. Easy pairing, C type charger, single device at a time connectivity, good bass, no volume control, sound quality good at 70% range, no noise cancelation, music pause, resume and next works fine with touch. Overall good product in this price range."
"Say you are running with your phone in your pant pocket and you have these plugged in. Turn your neck to one side and your music will get shaky. Can’t imagine how the connection could become so weak with such little obstruction!One side stopped working after 3 weeks.The touch input zone or the lighting is not useful. There is no feedback against any tap on the unit.Utter waste of money. All boat TWS have disappointed so far.Boat makes the best neckbands, but they should give up making these tws."
"Awesome sound quality, highly recommend for bass lovers, instant connectivity. I'm using them with Samsung M30s and I'm having no lagging or delay during games. Outdoor connectivity and noise cancellation is beyond awesome. 6mm dynamic drivers but you will not miss 10mm cz you will have the same quality of what a 10mm driver can possibly have."
"Purchased based on the reviewAfter 6 months of use , right side ear piece/pod produced very low output(reduced volume).Solution:Product was returned at service center and i was told that I would get replacement for the same.Result:I received a replacement by Boat which was a used product and was covered with ear wax.I will not even test OR use this product by looking at unclean earwax inside."
"I enjoy listening both to music and podcasts, and as such, I keep listening to things throughout the day. And it's not that these earphones are bad from the perspective of sound quality.But, their size is such that it will hurt people because of it's unevenly distributed weight, regardless of what tips you use. The bulk at the back really adds to the pressure. The other issue is that it does not work well on flights at all. Hardly any passive noise blocking, forget cancellation.Overall, it's a fairly priced product and decent quality as well. But if your ear canal is small, the distributed weight issue will affect you."
"As good as the sound quality is, the connectivity is abysmal. Simply turning your head while using the headphones causes an instant disconnection. I've tried this on multiple devices (not only phones but tablets, desktops and laptops).Notice cancellation is virtually non-existent. It's noise isolation, of course and that itself isn't great.The mic doesn't work anymore. Don't know when it stopped but it definitely worked when I first got the earphones.I'd give the product 4 stars for sound quality. 1 star for build quality. 0 for connectivity."
"Using it from 2 months. The ear buds are comfortable to wear and are light weight.But there are 3 major issues with the ear buds.1. Frequently gets disconnected.2. Audio is not loud and clear.3. Some times one of the buds don't get charged properly (in my case left ear buds has charging issue)This ear buds have excellent battery backup and are very much comfortable if you use it for longer duration.I use it for my morning walks, the audio is not that great and the volume is low when compared to mivi and redmi(under 2.5k-3k)."
"I have been using this air dopes 441 for the last 6 months. I have had my doubts about how it would work and the quality of the sound. These headphones totally surprised me. Sound quality is great. Bass is great. Noise cancellation is good. One big advantage is it being wireless so that we can move about doing our things. One con is that while on calls the other person would hear more of our surroundings, so it cannot be used to take calls in noisy environment. On the whole am really about the purchase as none of the wired headphones lasted for me for more than 6 months"
"The product is ok. Overall good noise cancellation but only issue is connectivity. Sometimes only 1 side works. I had to factory reset it to get both dopes working again. Sound is ok but bass sometimes mask the voice. Overall fine product. The power bank capability of case is useless as it can just juice up the phone to 15% on full charge. And 150 hrs claim is useless. The case can charge airdopes only 5 to 6 times i.e., 25 to 30hrs. I suggest going for basic airdopes 441 and not pro."
"In these times of WFH, having a decent pair of TWS earphones is more of a necessity rather than a desire. These earphones are a bang for the buck. I'll divide my review in pros and cons and my experience with the 441 Pro after about a month of use. My review will only be based on the Indoor Usage of these earphones as I am too afraid to use TWS earphones while an outdoor workout or otherwise.Note:- The only difference between the Boat Airdopes 441 and Airdopes 441 Pro is the battery capacity of the charging case. The former comes with a 500 mAh battery while the latter comes with a 2600 mAh battery capacity.Pros:-1. These offer a very balanced sound.2. They have a good amount of bass which is not overpowering and if you use an equaliser you can boost the bass even further but that is not recommended as it overpowers the highs and the midtones.3. They have very good passive noice cancellation. A person will literally have to stand on your head and shout his lungs out for you to be able to hear him.4. The earphones have a battery life of about 5 hours without the charging case.5. The charging case comes with a 2600mAh battery which also doubles as a powerbank. In my month of usage I have charged the case only twice till now and that is when I use the airdopes on a daily basis.6. Has USB type C charging with a charging cable bundled inside the box. You also get two extra silicone eartips for varrying ear sizes.7. The case supports Fast Charging8. The airdopes have a capacitive touch that is surrounded by a ring of led lights which glow in different colors depending on the function they are performing.9. The earphones are very light weight and have an official IP X7 rating making them swearlt proof which means they can be used in the gym or while outdoor workouts though I have not used these for that very purpose.10. The earphones are magnetically held inside the case which provides a secure position to them.11. You can perform many functions with the earphones like pick up or end calls, play/pause music, use voice assistants etc.Cons:-1. The charging case is big and feels heavy when compared to something like the case of Apple Airpods. This might be because of that huge 2600 mAh battery that the case has.2. If you are a sort od person who likes to fit your tws charging case in your coin pocket then this is not for you. It just doesn't fit inside the coin pocket of jeans and you'll need to keep it inside the phone pocket or the wallet pocket because it is a big case and takes up quite a bit of real estate.3. The lid of the charging case doesn't open up sufficiently for one to take out the earphones comfortably. The lid opens at a 90 degree angle which is not sufficient enough given the stability of the lid is low. It has happend many times with me that while taking out the earphones my finger just slightly touches the case lid and it comes crashing down.4. The rubber rings around the earphones that are provided for a secure fit in the ear start causing pain after about an hour or half of use and then you have to remove the earphones. However the good side is that these rings are removable.5. The overall ergonomics of the case and the earphones need a bit of rework for a more user friendly experience.Overall, I'd say if you are a bass head and dont want to burn a hole in your pocket then go for these earphones or even Boat Airdopes 441.Hope my review helps you make an informed decision while making a purchase."
"General- The airdopes come with a very sensitive touch control panel. A little bit too sensitive but it is also the best touch control in this price range and so is the connectivity.Battery - The battery backup is really good just like it is shown. The eardopes and the charging case charge relatively fast. So if you are looking for battery and can't afford the pro version, go for the base version without any doubt.Sound quality - The sound quality is really nice even with the 6mm drivers the bass and the loudness are perfectly matched for me as I am a bass lover but if you are not one then the bass might be a bit muchLatency - If you are a gamer and want it for gaming then I don't reccomend buying this one or any Bluetooth earbuds. You should rather buy a wired headphone but if you really need a Bluetooth earbud in budget then I recommend the realme buds q as it has a larger driver size, lower price and lower latency"
"I purchased by January 8Two or three days back the charge was dropped to Single light out of four. I'm trying to say the battery backup is really really great.Water resistant ✔️Sound quality ✔️Issues I faced :Slightly it gets disconnected and connects automatically,It's light weight but after continuous and long hours of usage i felt heavy on ears. It's natural but I have to mention it.Credits to:Perfect fit in ears,Audio clarity while speaking in calls,Looks good!"
"Pros:1 good sound quality2 Bass and treble output is great for such small size and price range3 voice is clear while calling, surprisingly better than my white elephant of sony worth 5k. HAHAHA!4 sweatproof5 playtime is good6 supports voice assistance that's amazing.7 easy to charge and operate8 charging case comes with a magnet so earbuds fit in easily in the case.Cons:1 Either there is a problem with my ears or these earbuds are not exactly designed for use while workout, I always felt like it may fall down if I keep running.2 Deep bass is good  but not that good , if I have to rate the bass quality I would give 3 out of 53 noise cancellation is good but not so great. definitely not bad for this price range, 3 out of 5 for that too."
"For the price, these are a good set of earbuds. I mainly use them while working out. It has a good fit and haven’t faced any connection issues till now. Battery life is also good, though I haven’t exactly measured it. One improvement I can suggest is to improve the build quality of the hinge mechanism for the charging case."
"Brought this product at offer price. I like this because 1) It's  Boat, 2) Low price 3) Awesome sound 4) Instant connect 5) Highly sensitive touch 6) compact 7) No pain can wear till the battery lasts 8) No headache .. can use for hours, Around 3 Hrs play.  It does not stop wen u remove any side while playing; it continues to play untill u keep it in the charging deck or case. No volume but u can't expect at low price Buds even AirPods does hve that facility.  Value for money."
My Right Pod discharges very fast. Used only for 20mints. Update: Sent Airdopes for service. The service was delayed. There was no communication from their end. I had to call customer service for more then 5 times to talk to customer service personnel. They said they r sending a replaced product. Once I got the product. My right one is working fine the left side isn't charging at all. I understand the delay is bcoz of Covid but my problem is not solved yet. Now can't get hold of customer service personnel to even register my complaint.
Sound quality is not upto expectation and value for money. We get better product for even lesser amount...I bought this in offer price (1999.00)....
"The airdopes 441 pro  are one of the best in this range.I git this buds in ₹2,500/-And if you get this on yhis price than grab the deal you won't find anything Better at this range..The fit of buds is great i wear turban and it doesn't hurt when i wear in turban..Voice quality is greatNo connectivity issues seen till nowCall quality is nice i used these while driving and there were no issuesLooks are sporty and greattouch control is nice...If you love bass in your music grab the deal..."
"Call quality is very poor, also its not user friendlyfirst impressions arecase is quite bigdoesn't fit properly in the earscall gets disconnected easily while wearing themclarity isn't thereits quite a pain to adaptcrossbeats one i have seems to be lot better than this oneand apple earpods are way better but not sure if the price difference is worth it .."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 *****update after 2 months of use >>>  i am confused now because it is not getting diacharged after 2 months of use and battery shows 2 points since a long time..ghost thing like feeling i have now*************its a good pair of earbuds in this price of rs 2499/-sound quality is good, pairs with thr mobile phone without any husstle and battery is good too...everything is good about it...case is also handy and there is a button to check the power left.this earbuds is lacking just one thing..and that is like..therr is no option to increase/decrease the volume using the earbuds..this can only be done thorugh the cellphone. no option of increasing or decreasing the volume using the earbuds touch feature. otherwise there is no negetive point about it."
Bought this product a week ago during republic day offer. This is the first time I'm using TWS buds. That's why I searched alot for these like which one should to buy and what are their pros over wired ones. So at last I chose this one over realme buds q and some of the noise products and many others too. So I have done my home work and it was really time taking like watching abound videos on YouTube and gone through different sites to search for the best. So i can assure you that this is the best quality earbuds in terms of everything but below 2000 price list. Because I've done the research after limiting my budget 🙃.  Thank you.
Amazing product. Currently I'm using realme buds wireless. This is my first tws earbuds. These are the best tws earbuds under 2k. Fits perfectly in my ears. Sound quality is amazing. Bass is just dope🔥🔥. If you are a bass lover definitely this is for you. Build quality is also great. Connectivity is seamless whenever you open the lid it's connect within a seconds.  Passive noise cancellation work pretty well. Instant wake pair function is cherry on cake. Feels premium in hand. And looks is killer and everyone notice due to its RGB lights. Touch sensitivity is excellent. Call quality is good for indoors and but average for outdoors. If you are in a crowded area next person will getting some background noise but that's okay. Consider this price it's negligible.  No volume control. If you are confused between Boat airdopes 441 and Boat airdopes 381. Definitely bought 441. I bought it in lightning deal in 2k. So I would suggest you to buy this in lightning deal.Delivered in one day. 🔥🔥😎🤟🏻
"The first pair of headphones I received I had to I replace as the people on the other end complained that they could barely hear me.After I received the replacement, the problem persists.On top of that the capacitive touch panels are terribly sensitive, the slightest touch disconnects an ongoing call.Would not recommend if you plan to use for calls. Okayish for music."
"These earbuds are ofcourse really good for having massive experience of listening music, watching movies and playing games. But when comes to calling, these earbuds experience issue in receiving sound through mic. I have experienced this many times that the sound is not audible to my most callers and they always complain me that my voice is not loud and helplessly I have to switch to phone mic then."
"Its a really good pair of Airdopes. Good bass.I wear it during my workout I was worried that it will fall but the wing thing prevents it from falling. It not very comfortable when worn for a long duration.Battery backup is great I use it every day at night, during the workout (1hr) and sometime in the morning after all this, I have to charge it every 7-9 days. and for this price range, these earphones make a great choice. I've known boat for pretty good sound quality and really punchy bass, and this offers that very well these look pretty good too, and sit almost flush with the ear. No protrusion whatsoever. The fit is amazing, and they just don't come off no matter how much I try to shake them off."
"So, for people who are thinking of buying these earbuds I would say go for it. Because all that really matters is connectivity and sound quality, for which I think it’s good. The insta pairing works very well for me and the sound quality is also great. The battery life is ok I guess, it’s just 3 hours ( it’s fine for me ). It also has touch controls which makes it easier to use by just touching, unlike the AirPods Pro which requires squeezing, so that’s a good thing. So if you’re a budget minded person who needs the quick pairing feature and good sound quality, I think it’s safe to say JUST BUY IT ( instead of JUST DO IT )"
"I find them really nice. I basically use them to connect to my smart TV and my personal laptop to listen to songs and for entertainment. The sound quality is great. But my ears get itchy after a few minutes and I have to scratch my one ear or the other randomly, but this may be due to my ears, so will not comment further on this. I have not tried the noise cancellation on this, but yes, I spoke to my wife over the phone using these TWS, and my wife could hear me find without any background noise. Noise cancellation will be best tested when on a client call, and I use a separate headset dedicated for that, since my office system does not have Bluetooth connectivity available. Overall, the experience is good."
"Packaging as always best no room for complaint there , Build quality excellent too , feels premium , Sound quality need to be improved , there's  is a bit of faint  eletricaL shimmering disturbance that is bothersome at times for which I ordered a replacement which it was but defect still persists , so product needs a bit of refinement and at times you might be addressing slight of heating issue in  an airdopes , and  it takes time to get used to this design as it may cause discomfort to 👂& needs to be readjusted . Overall I am extremely satisfied with the back up it has , quick charging, robust build quality , areas that need to be upgraded is eleminate unnecessary noise generated due to discharge & demands more cushioning so that it doesn't render the ears aching.how ever after 8months of use one ear buds mic has malfunctioned now looking forward to get it repaired"
"First of all these buds fits in your ears perfectly and you won't feel any pain and these are lightweight and small in size compared to others.The ""SOUND"" Quality is the best in this range and bass is so gooood. But only you need to play HD music (128bit/320bit) to feel real magical sound.AND Call quality is superb and clear.You can use 4- 4.5 hrs for single full charge and no connectivity issuesThank you boat."
"I am not happy with the product.First of all, it is not unique product for everyone. I got ear pain after some time as it is ""IN THE EAR"" type. So I cannot use it for continuously.Worst part is connectivity. As it is mentioned, each bud cannot be used to tow different phones at the same time. I am unable to use one bud for one phone and the other bud to another phone. When I bought 1st one, worked for 3 days and again stopped and I am unable to vonnect to my phone OPPO F15.I asked for replace which I got. Thanks to Amazon service. But 2nd product also not convenient..So I returned it completely and I got refund on the same day.Sound quality is not good.Base is not up to mark.Not at all recommended."
i really like the product sound quality is good and its look stylish too. The only thing that I find negative about is that when ever i'm on call or listening yo music if i accidentally touch the sensing area the call will cut and music will stop. I wish it had double touch system to close the call and stop the music but aside from the every thing is good.(note-I have long hair and even they touch the sensing area i face the problem that i mention above so make sure to tie you hair carefully and be cautious of your hand when you use them)about rest its great
"I got these ear phones looking at all specs and colours. I have used wireless but They were my first earbuds , and after using them I realised what I should have checked into more. These are good for music but two important drawbacks are that the noise cancellation is bad so if you are outside, travelling or in a public place ,you won’t be able to talk on phone with these. With mask in Covid times it becomes more difficult. You have to speak really loud for the other person to hear something and without mask. Second aspect is that they are bulky and heavy, so they tend to fall off easily from your ears, making it difficult to wear them while running and they also make your earlobes ache. So overall not a good choice so be careful if it’s your first time!"
Always used BOAT and Loved it. Here is my honest review :1. Comfortable - 4 Star ( May be little uncomfortable for 1-2 days  - I did not feel anything). It's very light weighted you can use all day.2. Audio - 3 Star (With this range it could be better ). Audio is great for listening music but could be better according to price.3. Noise Cancellation - 4 Star ( You will be not disturbed with any noise while listening to songs). Ofcourse it doesn't stop 100% noise but it's acceptable and very nice.4. Battery - 4 Star (7 to 8 Hours without use of Battery Case )5. Touch - 5 Star ( You have to make little habit but this makes the Airdopes so much cool and works just awesome).Overall I think this product is nice and there is nothing negative till now ( I am using since last 10 days). But it could be cheaper or if not then it can be little more better according to it's price. I am satisfied with this one tho.
"I have used these Boat airdopes 441 pro for 1month now, It has powerful bass punchy bass (car subwoofer wali), Sound clarity is too good, you cannot even hear anything what's happening around (club vali feel dete hai). It looks good for gym freak also they don't need to put those massive headphones (same sound quality you get, without any wires and sweat that we get after wearing headphones for a long time). Its just OP surely upgrade yourself to NIRVANA."
Good features at this price touch response ergonomics battery backup all decentLooks veery localish with multicolored Led on topDecent sound quality however no comparison with sony or appleMostly suitable for listening music.. for call it's not smooth specially outdoors difficultBecause of heavy magnetic material can't hold in ears for long.. uneasiness in ear kicks in after  20 30 mins
Likes:1.Good experience  for music with good 4-5 hour  battery.2.Case have good charging  cycles  for pods.Dislikes:1.Voice calls are pain. User has to be too loud to be audible on call with lots of background noise.2.Case as power bank is ok for small phone (phone with small battey)
"Great job on the technology BOAT. This time your nailed it when it comes to balanced sound and comfort.Just a little equliisation on your phone software would enhance the quality of sound on these ear buds.Batery life and noise cancellation could have been better, otherwise worth 1,999 and can be compared with brands like samsung /blaupunkt /etcGo for it all you music lovers."
"Volume cannot be controlled from pods. The many flashing lights are confusing at first. Only used it a few times, but battery on case and pods seems to last long. Good looking in red and black. OK for using indoors only because it keeps falling out if you move so the in ear fit is not good. Overall average quality..esp in sound."
"due to exchange of first copy,i couldn't send my friend this birthday gift on time ,i feel bad for all the delay"
"I purchased it on 3rd march, today i am reviewing on 6th april after month.Its the best product i purchased. I am computer technician i have more field work so i purchased this for under helmate usage, it is smooth to use under helmate fits tight, smooth conversations and crisp and clear sound.I only charged the case one month ago its twenty persent remaing till today, i use single buds for day its smooth and i used it for directions on google maps its beautiful experience, not any bluetooth disconnection till now.Some reviews says static sound in left earbud its rubbish there is no static sound in any earbud. its best to buy in this price range, hope you like my review."
"Received on time ..cost me 2250/-Due to Touch sensitive buttons by mistake call gets disconnected !Not smooth earbuds, it pains after 10-20 mts of usage  but it's subjective.Range is very very poor ..voice gets breaking within 5 meter range in home.Seems durable and charging is c type and quick.Not in use and now lying idle in my drawerOverall average buy better to go one plus bullets type earbuds...."
"Sound quality is good especially it bass and treble is awesome and call quality is good and coming too noise cancellation it is not that great but ok and one of the best instant connection it will connect with in a seconds synchronisation for videos is good but for gaming there is delay in sound and Bluetooth range is really super you can use it in kitchen or hall even if the mobile is in bedroom regarding battery backup it is decent and longlast upto maximum 3-4 hours and with the case you can use it for more than 24 hours , overall this TWS is simply awesome so don't think twice of this product go for it really a worthy product and it is one of the best TWS now in market so whoever is buying this TWS they will feel really worth for it"
"Arrived  one day late then expected delivery 28.12.2020 ... package  is fine... Product  tested  and works quite  well as of today. 29.12.2020.... I'm  happy with all the handling  and regarding  the airdopes itself.. the spare ear piece and charger is coming  with it too. Let me add up.. I'm  really not a music lover.. i bought these pair mostly  for watching movie.. but right  now  I'm  listening  music, which is really great, the sound, the  noice cancellation, bass and all.. great product.. thank you Amazon.. I'm  a happy  Customer...😅"
"The sound quality of the product is really good when you listen to music etc. But the real problem lies in talking to people. There are various issues some of which are listed below.1. The range of the head phone is really poor.2. There are voice echo problems. People on other end of the call and you yourself hear double voice.3. There is lot of disruption while talking , connectivity issues. Sometimes the voice fades goes blank.4. The battery is also not so good.5. I have been connecting this to my only phone but most of the time then I have to reconnect again.The Company should focus on launching few products with good deliverables rather than making 100 products with all defects."
"The more praise you do for this product will be less....at this price the quality of product which boat have delivered is simply outstanding.Insta Wake and Pair, Bluetooth connectivity all are extremely good.Only thing is that the product price varies a lot, I have seen a variation of good 30% percentage withing a week both upward and downward...so that you can keep in mind while buying...but even at its highest price it's worth buying."
"Been almost a week since I've bought this so far it's working fine,no issues encountered with this, the sound quality is good even at 60-70% volume it sounds pretty nice,bass is nice, vocals are not missing,the charging case is quite elegant, However you can't use it for long hours,like after 30 minutes or so my ears start to hurt a little,the grip is a little too tight of sorts although you can manage it well for almost an hour but after that you'd need a break so there's that,plus if you have really small ears not recommended for you,I wanted this review to be detailed for whoever decides to buy this next,it's a good product just you can't use it constantly for long hours,also like is said it's just been a week if I face any issues I'd use my warranty,boat has good after sale service so it should be alright and I shall also update my review after that.Hope this helps ."
"To begin with, boat ⛵ has done a pretty good job here. It actually justifies the ₹2500 mark as per the sound signature produced on it. Also the design of the earbuds is very sleek, elegant and compact which snuggly fits into your ears, although you may have to change the ear-tips for better fit. There are 3 extra pairs of ear-tips, apart from the ones that come that come pre-applied over the TWS earphones, so in all 1 large, 2 medium size and 1 small sized ear-tips is what you get and you may have to change them according to what suits your needs. Also, since they are light weight, I didn't had any issues with listening for long (2-3) hours because some of them are complaining about the pain after wearing the buds for long. Also, mind you my review is based on 2 days of usage. Then speaking of sound signature, it is pretty balanced between treble and bass, I really like the tuning that they have done here. Also, the sound stage is awesome on this. It produces excellent mids (vocals), highs and lows and are adequately loud, although slightly less louder than my ptron tanget beat pro plus which is a neckband and my first wireless earphones, but this is a nitpicking, I'm doing here, I had got them for ₹699 and there is a difference of maybe 10% in terms of loudness, ptron go slightly ahead in that but they produce a very flat sound signature. Also, there is a slight latency or audio lag that you might notice while playing games only if you're pro user, otherwise it is negligible ~1ms lag, but that's completely fine considering what you're getting.  They support ENC (Environment Noise Cancellation) and AAC (Adavance audio coding), which enhances the audio output and experience. On the battery capacity front, they come with a 500mAh case and 35 mAh on each earpiece. On a single charge you can churn out as high as 7 hours backup per charge, but I've mostly used them 40% volume, so on average it might give you 4-5 hours of decent backup per charge at relatively higher volumes. Also, the case requires 90 minutes to charge fully and buds get from 30-100% within 25 minutes but I'm not sure because I didn't exactly measure the time.So in a jist, considering now that I got them at ₹1399, I would like to summarise my overall experience as;Loudness: 8/10.Bass and Treble; 8.5/10.ENC: 7/10.Overall sound signature (Mids, highs and vocals): 8/10.Touch Response: 9/10.Build Quality and design: 10/10.I cannot comment anything on microphone on these right now as I haven't took any calls over it,will update my review with time.Also, to maintain its battery health, I don't charge case and buds at the same time. Also, I don't keep buds in case untill I hit 20-30% battery mark to prevent overcharging, but once they charge completey, the charging stops and both buds can be stored in the case."
"The product is amazing and great sound. Most importantly I wanted to highlight the quality of product ( very proud of the fact it is Made in India). My son ( a toddler) threw these from 14th floor, they were lying in the rain over night and next morning when I used them.. they were working fine ( of course with some scratches).I have recommended to all my family and friends"
Everything's good including the case and buds. But one thing i can't help to notice is that i hear a minor buzzing sound iny left bud whenever i pause the music. I would be careful for that thing. Otherwise the product is good
"Got it yesterday.. these are the views of one day usage.Pros:- Big battery (2600mah) case makes it easy to handle the buds instead of charging it everyday.- Connects to my phone as soon as under 2 seconds of case opening.Cons:- Buds doesn't fit in ears correctly, I tried with all silicon ear pieces that they gave.- The silicon ear pieces provided are bit tougher than what I got for my other wired phones- There is no place to hold the earbuds without touching the captive touch sensor which is not convenient (we end up answering the call while keeping the first ear bud in the ear and ending the call while keeping the second one. Very bad design)- Earbuds battery level are not properly being displayed in the phone- Earbuds charge very quickly... Like in maybe 10-15 mins or so... Which is weird... I think they are not properly displaying the battery level.- Not comfortable in the ear, this button earbud design is hard to handle than the aripods design. Airpods just sit in the ear canal... These have to be pushed inside the ear canal and lock them for it to be properly be in the ear.- Sound is not that good.. I would say close to average quality... I feel good when I take them out of my ear.. you get my point with this sentance.Am planning to check for another day or so and see if I should keep them or return.The only reason I am still thinking of keeping these for now is the Big battery case.Will edit the post after 2-3 days for more info.Edit1:I returned it on 3rd day as it was hurting my ears while keeping them on.I learned that we don't need that Big battery case as in general cases we can't completely drain the buds and case charging in a day or two.The sound quality is not good as its bass is not equally distributed is what I felt.There are other better options in the same price range like oneplus buds z and other brand TWS.IMPORTANR NOTE: DRIVER SIZE DOES MATTER A LOT ON SOUND QUALITY."

I got these earbuds for 1999/- n the features offered at this price are amazing. I have couple of headfones n earphones from different brands like jbl philips. But couple of years ago i got my hands on boat rockers 400 and it was that moment i fell in luv with this brand coz the prices offered by anazon was ariund 1200. Now few days back i saw these airdopes441 being  offered at 1999 so i ordered them without thinking for second time.
"This is a genuine review after using it for 20 days.Battery 4.15 hours or 80% volume level....Lows are quite nice but not perfectMids and highs are decentAnd BASS is awesome....I tried realme buds Q, Oppo enco w11 but this one has louder sound...better battery and decent bass....if you are bass lover then go for it...this is the best in this budget... don't search for any other......Calling indoor is the best and in outdoor it is good....will not face any magor issue at all....Connectivity is awesome..just takes 1 second to connect"
"Music and cinema sounds great in this airdopes and the fit is also amazing. It wont fall off your ears for sure.The only problem i felt is about the mic, background noises are more amplified than the one who speaks. So its very difficult for the other person as they get a feel like the call is on loudspeaker.Apart from this music listening and fit this product is superb. Battery backup is also obtained as promised."
"Its been 6 months,I am using this tws, I got this tws in ₹1999.The bass quality feels very thumpy at this price.One of the best tws at this price.The sound quality is very good but It little bit lacks in soft songs but its great at this price.It very comfortable fit..I do heavy workout It will has never fall from my ear.If your budget is ₹2000 or ₹2500 go for it... great product 👍❤️🔥"
"Sound quality is great. The reason for giving a lower rating is -1. Although the buds do not come out of ear, I always keep thinking it is not fitted properly2. The sound cannot be controlled while using Zoom or Google Meet. Even if you mute the laptop sound, the buds have a large volume. Not experienced this when using YouTube or Amazon Music or similar music apps"
Worth the price.Sound quality is great and it is best for traveling. The battery back is good and also the chargable carrying case with power back up of upto 150hrs.Used it while working out and does not slip out or no discomfort. Not heavy in ears.The touch is pretty sensitive and it takes time to get used to it.Overall worth the price.Only thing which brothered me was the noise cancellation quality.
"For some of those who don't know, there are two different ways bluetooth headphones communicate with other devices. First one is used for one-way communication (for music). This is in stereo mode. The second mode is used for two-way communication (for talking on phones, meetings etc).This headphones work great in one-way communication, for music. Although bass is not that great.However, it does not work very well in second mode. Often both the ear pieces will play sound at different times. There is a lag between two ear pieces. Also, microphone is not that great. Other people often complain that they are getting a lot of background noise. So, attending meetings and phone calls is not advisable with these headphones."
"The airdopes are really good and the sound quality is highWe get little disturbances and lack of noise cancellations while in calls.The bass is good, the music quality is good, the battery performance is highly unbelievable we can use upto 5 to 8 hr per single charge of airdopes and the case contain 2600 mah which can be used upto 5 to 6 days in a single charge.Overall the airdopes are worth for its value.Easy to fit in ears. 3types of bud sizes, the dopes doesn't falldown if use in rogh condition also like running, jogging., exercising etc. We can wear All the time"
"Sound quality - 4Comfort - 4Ease of use - 4Build quality - 4Portability - 5Calling quality - 4Value for money - 5This product can be used while relaxing, meditating, working out, cycling, driving, house cleaning, commuting and at the workplace.Hell you can use one bud each to share music even  with a friend!It fits in your pocket and charges itself like a charm!Must buy product!"
"The BOAT Team did well on the product with all the good intent but there are some points which I did not like:1. The touch (capacitive?) is too sensitive. Slight touch of your hand will trigger the function.2. Both ear-buds' batteries do not last for the same time. One of them dies sooner making you switch to mono. I had gotten my first ear-buds replaced for this issue but it persists with the second set too.3. The ear phones cannot be used seamlessly with laptops. Although they can pair, but there will be audio delay/lag.4. Volume is tad low.Good things comes in small packages:1. Good bass2. Good noise isolation (passive).3. Very-very small hence portable (including the charging case).4. Fair treble."
"Worth every penny! Very good sound quality abd fits perfectly in the ears, doesn't hurt even after wearing them for a long time.As compared to Boult Audio AirBass Powerbuds, these ones are anyday better than boult ones, in terms of sound as well as comfort. I had a bad experience of having received a defective boult product and the replacement was also a used product, so had to return those as well.Go for these without a doubt!"
"Firstly the product is fine for the price range of Rs 2500 and please don't give more than that for this product.Why I returned it?1. Very bad sound in the background when the earbuds were not playing anything. (might be a defect in the product I received)2. Build quality is not great.3. I mainly bought it for the battery backup but I was disappointed with the audio which is much more important to anyone.4. Delay while watching some videos. Controls work sometimes and other times I don't know why they get stuck.I feel, if you want good quality in audio without a very tight budget then if you shell out another Rs500 to Rs1000 you can get really better ones."
"I usually don't write review unless the product is truly impressive but whenever the product quality exceeds your expectations, you are compelled to write a review. Being Gadget freak and Audiophile, any Audio product I buy the core criteria has to be BASS effect. Whether its Car Speaker, Woofer, Subwoofer, Sound bar, Headphone, Earphone and these days Airpods... The first thing I read in product review is BASS Effect. After having returned 2 Airpods earlier due to Ordinary Sound Quality, I wasn't expecting too much on BASS Front. But since I already have one Boat over the head, bluetooth headphone I was aware of Boat Audio Quality so went for Boat TWS 441. And I can say if u r BASS Crazy like I am, u at least wont be disappointed. Forget not that this is earphone and not headphone so u can't have too loud a sound. But I am truly impressed by the Booming BASS effect of this piece. It has become my go-to earphone for listening to my favorite Audio Tracks."
"This review is after 2 months of daily use. I got these in Aug'20 for 1999/-.The buds and the box is made of plastic and is very light. There is no premium feel to it.They are a good deal when compared to other earbuds for the same price range. On an average the ear buds last for approx 3 hrs on a single charge. The box and the buds together last for almost 20 hours. Charging time is approx 2 hours. The earbuds have a audible battery indicator which says ""Oops Battery Low"" when the battery level in the buds drop to around 10%. There is also a battery indicator that is displayed in the notification bar of your phone.Considering that both the batteries in the earbuds are the same, the right earbud battery drains more quickly than the left. The left will work for another 30-45 minutes after the right one has died.The sound quality is good however the bass is a little to much. However, Boats are known for their high bass earphones. A Boat app with equalizer and other functions would have really made a difference, however there is no equalizer option, neither can you change or control the volumes through the ear buds.The audio quality and clarity during calls is good.The Bluetooth reception however is not too great. The buds tend to loose connection with your phone at a distance of approx 15/18 feet. Sometimes a single wall between me and my phone can make it loose connection.The capacitive buttons work well but are a little too sensitive. If you accidently touch the bud when you touch your head or ear, it will register as a press and will pause or change the track.Will need to see how they perform over the period of time.Overall this is a good buy for the current price range considering the playback time and sound quality."
"Great design love how it's compact and simple, fits perfectly in my ear with the default buds if not there are different sizes to choose from. Seemless paring on any device (PC, Game console, Phones are the ones that I tested on, no issues whatsoever) However don't recommend it for gaming! Okayish battery life around 4-5 hours on a single charge and the case can charge up the buds upto 3 times with a full battery of itself! Touch controls are a bit fuzzy sometimes doesn't work that well especially in wet conditions or if you're covered in sweat or water! Bass is good, noise cancelation works really well and over all feels premium. Totally would recommend it!"
"The airdopes just got delivered and I've spent the last hour listen to them without a break. I don't think I'm taking one anytime soon.I must say I'm really impressed with the quality of this product. Offers amazing base with clear trebles. For the ones who are sceptical about the noise cancellation I must say it isn't bad, maybe just a notch below par the standards set by its other features.The functionality is fairly simple compared to other products in the same segment.Loved it!A big shout-out to boat (Vocal for Local) 🙂"
"Bought it one day. Then i wanted to return it the next day. Why? u may ask.Main reason - The touch response scales from very bad to non-existent.Mini reason - doesn't fit well in my earsOkay then... I got to know that u can't return this wonderful device on 1st attempt coz replacement policy comes 1st. U see... I'm a sensible person and was like '' no problem! The replacement might be better''.I received the replacement few days later.Surprise! Surprise! They fooled me twice. The earbuds worked well... Only for the 1st 2 days. Then came the same inevitable touch response problem. I was like ""ugh... They work sometimes when I reset the buds. I'm all for Indian tech so I'll try to manage. I'll just stop using the touch controls''. (lemme tell u that I paid 2k for this)2 days later.....chapter - 2 had begun.One of the buds kept disconnecting constantly and required frequent resetting of the buds. This! My friends... is where I draw the line. I want to return it asap. But that thing is.. It is midnight rn and u can't return this item without talking to a customer service person 1st (top-notch huh?!).Hmm... So here I am writing a review for this amazing product in the middle of the night coz that's how annoyed I am. Hope I can return it tomorrow. Take care guys... I hope u are lucky."
"Was searching for mid range true wireless earpods, settled for boAt Airdopes 441, I have used it extensively, sound quality is good yet the shape makes it difficult to wear for long timePro :1. Light weight2. Good sound quality for the price range3. Good noise cancelation4. Good compatibility with laptopsCons :1. Its shape makes it difficult to use for long time for listening"
Purchased for 2499. Next level audio quality. Noice cancellation works excellent.  Next level Hi-Res audio system. Purchase without second thought.
"One day it just stopped working.. there was this connecting sound and all. But the songs played on the phone just couldn't be heard in the earphone.. I tried with another phone too.. same.. but, some days later, it started working properly..This puts doubts on its reliability..Also, when I talk on it, the person on the other side hears the noise in an amplified way.. don't know if there are any adjustments that can be done to rectify this..So, noise cancellation, I'd say, is very poor.."
Got for 1599 Rs in Amazon Great Indian Festiv sale.Not at all satisfied with the sound quality.There is low sound and not high. Bass is also low. We can only feel bass in some music which are purely bass based. For the people who are Heavy bass and sounf liver it is NOT FOR THEM. Call quality is Ok. But overall it is not good. According to price of 2499 rs (without sale price) if you want to buy than you have many option than this.There is NO FEEL for sound while listening.
"The product stopped working 1.5 years after purchase. It was a good product for its price, don't expect the best of everything at this price range. Compact size, good fit, decent sound. It's not the best sound, its loud. But I wish it would have lasted longer.It suddenly just stopped charging and then the earpieces (right one) stopped working."
"A good product.The touch sensitive surface is a bit annoying as it can easily be triggered by slightest of touch or adjustment of earphones while in the ear.Overall,a good product. Sound quality is good and good microphone for talking on call. Decent battery lifeGreat for travelers."
"These Airdopes are good as compared to others in the same budget. Sound quality is excellent. One may face range problem if you phone is in the pocket he or she can face noise distortion some times. Moving further, batter life is very good not as mentioned but still okay. Looks are perfect but you may get bit low vibes from inside. Fitting is perfect you can use these while running, jogging and gyming. They don't get harmed in sweat but I haven't tried them in water. Touch function are not that much quick. If you are looking for good Airdopes under 3000 INR you should go for these."
"I rarely write reviews. This is a great product - only for the first year. The moment it stepped on the 13th month, issues popped up (mine is in the 14th month). The left earbud currently has only 30 minutes of battery life - pathetic!!! Also, every 1 or 2 minutes either of them will lose volume and i have to put it in the case and take it back out to regain the volume. Cannot use it anymore for movie watching, music or even online classes. If not for that the product is amazing. But whats the use... a butterfly doesn't live long. So, buy the product with that in mind."
After using these airdopes for around 3 months i am writing this review and i must  saw it is an another awesome product with a good price as always.I bought it in a sale and got it for 2500Sound quality is awesome and bass quality too is terrific.If you talk about noise cancellation it is also very good in terms of other products  in this price range.There are three issues(major or minor you decide on your own)-:1. Battery life for each earbud is low as they comes with a small battery and case gives them 4 charges as said by company but the battery life of each of them is just 4-4 and half hours with continous usage with volume 60%-70%.2.This might not be an issue for people who only just loves bass but these airdopes are pre configured by company to give maxx output in terms bass this means that vocals are little suppresed by bass all the time and you want vocals to be good and bass less then there is an option but it depends on device i.e by using equalizer3.I think this is a major issue that there are no touch controls for adjusting volume of airdopes and it is set to 100% everytime you start them for laptops it is always set to 100% when i connect them but in smartphones android normalizes the volume to 40%And if you are planning to use with smart tv then forget about it as there no controls on buds for volume and most of the smart TVs don't support volume adjustment of bluetooth devices from them.Thank you for giving it a reading and i would be very happy to help fellow buyers.
"Quality of the buds are premium.. good material used for the case, the best advantage of 441pro version is battery life once charge the buds easily you can use it for a week. Fitting is fine but i feel u cannot use it continuously for long time.. Overall very good earbuds for the price .. I got it for 2499 on launch day"
"Had two accidents which needs to be mentioned.1) the case with earphones fell from my hand and survived the fall.2) one bud fell into a small bucket full of water from my ear has I had not fitted it properly and was immediately picked up. Dried using towels and after 5 mins ready to play.So build quality is very good. Fitting has been perfect for me.Now to the most important part- sound quality. Though drivers are small but music is balanced and bass is good for the price.Connects to TV, mobile and Laptop with ease, range is just OK not great. Sometimes connectivity is an issue and had to put it back to the case to replug.No outdoor use done yet."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Battery life is not as advertised its gets around 2 hours of playtime on a single charge which is 3 hours shy of the 5 hours mark. It has become a real pain to charge it again and again and the case doesn't provide 25 hours it does around 3-4 charges at max. Left Touch button is unresponsive most of the time. Sound quality is fine but the fit is somewhat uncomfortable. My final verdict don't get these if you intend to use them for extended periods of time . If you want to use them in gym or go for a jog it'll be fine no problem."
"Sound quality is quite impressive for 6mm drivers .. I thought it would be bad , but it's really okay like 8/10.. I wish it would be a bit more louder, charging is really good, bass is nice too , very slight glitches in connection but not too disruptive.. overall a 7/10 product.. but I bought it early.. if you are planning to buy a good one wait for airdopes 441pro launching soon.. or go for Boult air audio .. all of these are at the same price of 2.5k .. Boult ones have volume controls too but are a bit heavy though having lightweight graphene drivers which should also consume low power."
"Bought in Rs.1999 /-.Pros:1. Good Battery Backup.2. Great Bass.3. Can use for long duration continuously as it easily fit into your ears, no ears pain issue.4. Great design as look wise.5. Touch sensors.6. Connectivity is too fast and can easily work in 7-8 meters range.Cons:1. While calling, you have to speak too loud.Overall great experience.Must buy product if you get it under 2k rupees."
Pros-1. A value for money product (got it for 2k in bbd)2. Fits well and doesn't fall off (after sometime we can figure out that certain angle in which it remains fit and comfortable)3. Good battery life4. Good sound quality5. Easy controlsCons-1. Not a good microphone. I can hear the other receiver but that person cannot hear me2. Many times it automatically gets disconnected when I'm on a call
"I received the product with some defect. The left side of the airdops was making unwanted sound which is irritating after each and every small input.I'm purchased product on 15/09/2020. He sells me Refurbished or replacement product as showing new . Products cell is open , Charging case is damage on case scratch are showing . Charging cable is missing pls see all plzDON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."
"I have been using this more than 6 months now. I bought it since is half the price of a comparable JBL or SONY Bluetooth headphones. I sadly realise that the sound quality is also half as good. The other features like battery, iwp and wearing comfort are all 5 star but the sound quality is about 50% of the well known brands. I will not buy this again."
"Looking out for glamour and powerful Ear buds with Perfect noise cancellation Ear buds then this is it. Go for it, I must say the main good part is pairing and touch sensitivity of Pause/Play and Receiving the Incoming Calls.Appearance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Sound Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Pairing ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Ear Support ⭐⭐⭐⭐Type C Cable ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Purchased it for 1999.00 INR from Amazon and Feels like worth for Dusshera gift to self.Highely Recommend to Buy this 👍Don't forget to check out the detailed Pics 🎉"
I bought this with some trepidation as a few reviews had said the voice quality over calls was just average. I use it mostly for calls at home and found the voice quality to be excellent with the person on the other side able to hear me clearly.  I have not tried it outside in a noisy environment. The monopod function also works well and the buds stay firmly in the ear. I have used it during workouts both the weight lifting and the HIIT variety and the buds have not come out. The shark fins are made of rubber and are quite comfortable.
1-3 hours battery backup that is not enough2- you will get an headache if continue listening songs for 1 hour due to heavy bass and treble not matched accordingly3- not ment for office use ( for meeting calls) as mic not sensitive that much4- tuff to carry as they can be in your ears or elese in the case that job to put that in case is will be next level headache5- to much heavy for ears6- final conclusion- purchase if you want to listen songs for time pass dont imagine too much with these ear dotsLike u can't put them in ears all the time and to carry its case in your pocket is tuff too& Yes not practical to use for office work from home meetingsSo the cose is too much than you will use in practical life
I ordered boat 441 but defected item got very poor connectivity after replace i got another one which have good sound quality good bass but after only 7 days automatically stops left ear bud only touch response shows after resetting only one earbud reset another one not reset and then problem gone bigger resetting or half resetting didn't discoverable bluetooth on my devices.Worst product ever not for sound but for build quality.After one day one earbuds starts charging again
"Writing this review after 8 monts of purchase. Great bluetooth devce. Just perfect to wear with hardly any pressur on ear canal and at the same time fits snugly. Sound quality is really good with nice bass. Touch sensor is sesitive enough but i face the problem only while pocking up the calls, otherwise its nice. Accidently one of the bud fell from my hands in water pothole some 7 months back and fortunately nothing happened to it. Its still functioning without any trouble. Truely waterproof we can say. On the battery i rarely charge it when i travel in my car, may be once or twice a week or so, and have never faced the problem of completly drained batterry. All in all i will its a value for money device. Go for it."
Used product for 2 Days 🙏1) Right ear bud does not connect to the mobile unless it is placed back in the power case ( though it is mentioned in the guide - it should not be that frequent it happend almost 2 times  in one hour)2) Power back up is not up to promised3)Touch controls are not that responsive incase of siri and  controls ( it is  annoying  when songs get automatically started even when you don't select anything )4)  Ear Tips are to hard - Ears starts paning if it is worn for more than 1 hour5)Boat  Airdopes 441 is as similar as this product the only difference is  Water resistance and power backup which is not that worthy for the increase of 1000rs
"When I ordered I got defective product with only one bud working. then I replaced and got another new box. Initially I tested with calling, the opposite person can able to hear me. But after few days when I noticed whenever I am going way from my phone my voice is not able to hear to opposite person. Then I realized the mic wholes are only for show. Actually it hasn't MIC feature. When you connected to mobile I speaking to over the phone only you can hear the sound but you should keep mobile with you only for Mic. So finally this product is only for Listening purpose. Waste of money"
"Very good for bass lovers, writing this review  after using 2 weeks.Very comfortable to wear and it won't fall down from your ear. every day I'm doing fitmess workouts and even I didn't feel to coming out like when I'm running. But  I'm feeling  a little heavier after using continuously  2 hours playtime . More than 3 hours continues  play time stylish and instent bluetooth connectivity is very nice I liked it..."
"The sound quality of the product is very good at such a low price because i have purchased it for ₹1999 so in my opinion at such cheap price no other earphones can compete. Even after wearing earpods the surrounded noise get cancelled which increases the music experience...about base quality there is no such word which can inform you all about but in bauas language it is "" f sai rocking awesome"".."
"Overall the product is decent. But the noice cancellation is really not great , also the microphone is not good for calling. I have to take one earplug out and hold it near my mouth so that the person calling me can hear clearly.Connectivity is great and touch response is also good.So i would say if you want these for music and Netflix. Its Great but voice and video calling is not good with these."
"If you don't play anything or pause the sound for a few moment, one of the earpiece automatically gets disconnect. This is super annoying as well as irritating. Suppose you have to talk to someone or listen to something in between the songs or videos and you pause the sound. At that moment one will get disconnected and if you start the song or video again, you will only hear it in one of the earpiece. This makes it impossible to interact with people in between you songs. Suppose You have a helmet or a scarf or something around your head or the case is not easily reachable. In that case you have to remove the helmet or something, remove both the earpiece, put them together inside the case, close the case and connect it again and insert it again in you ear. This makes it super useless for day to day life activities. I don't know why one disconnects if the song or the video is paused for a moment. If anybody has a solution please comment it below."
Hi I was using jbl earbud before this. However it was not waterproof and I screwed it up in running.Sound : comparable no issuesNoise control: this is not having good noise cancellationFit has an issue sometime I feel pain in my ears if I wear it for longConnectivity is good as u don't hv to on/ off before you startOverall a good deal and feeling satisfied so far
"They were awesome at first. The ear pains a little because of it's structure. But the grip and the sound quality is very nice. The product worked fine for a month but then there were some issues with it.Contacting the boat service centre was difficult to at first. The phone number given on their website is always busy.Then I wrote them a mail and then on the communication was easy but their service is too slow. It's been a month now and I still haven't received the airdopes back! It's very irritating... They give the reason of covid but a month is really not acceptable...If you are looking for some nice Bluetooth headset, I suggest you buy JBL's headphones... I have them and have never faced an issue.Boat's service is awful and trust me you don't want to go through the trouble of replacement."
"The first pair of airdopes which I received were defective, so I ordered a replacement. Now the replacement airdopes have also stopped working and it's just been a month since I got them. Did not expect this from Boat. I can't return it or replace it now and I've paid for something that I cannot use. Disappointed!"
The only thing i can fault is that there is chrrrpp sound from the left earpod that starts after you pause music or disconnect the call !Please everyone check once pausingt the music and pay attention to the left earpod there’s a chrrp sound or i am the only one who go the deffect / deffective piece
"I bought it as boAt is famous for its base volume  but did not find much effective during the music.The voice over call was not audible enough for listerner so 0 points of call, for music 3 out of 5However over period of few days found out it can be used for listening to music, watching movies or playing games especially who wants to know pubg..can go for it because of its special power bank. And low latency for online streaming and games.Price can be reduced further.At same.time.i also order one plus wireless Z and boAt 261 much better piecenof equipment with lower costMy recommendation under 2000 budgetOnePlus wireless z amazing 10 hours backSeinhiezer wiredBoat 411 pro ( 2400 during prime day sale)Boat 261"
"VALUE FOR MONEY: Paisa VasoolSound quality: Good, actually best below 5000/- range.Noise cancellation: not cool but can live with it not a deal breaker. If you still want good noise cancellation, cough up some extra bucks (7-10,000/-)Bass Quality: excellent for the price point it is available. Bassheads will not regret buying it (though select the right buds from supplied package).All in all, good value for money"
Very bad product. Amazon this time you disapponted me. I am not sure why you listing such poor product on Amzon. I first bought it on 8 Aug 2021 and after 3 days left side earbud stopped working and again on 14 Aug 2021 i requested repalcement and on 16th Aug 2021 i received repalced product and this time you sent me defective product in which right earbud completetly not working. Neither its searchable nor right earbud flashing after touching for it for few sec. I tried to reset it but no luck. Never Buy this product they are delubrately selling defective product on Amazon ro cheat people. Please initiate refund for this product else i will stop shopping on Amazon and suggest my all relatives not to use Amazon.
"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. This is gonna be a detailed review and I will cover mostly all the features and topics.Pros:1. The sound quality is extremely good, clear audio and detailed treble and bass.2. The bass is deep and covers all the high, mid and lows.3. The IWP-Instant Wake Pair technology works pretty well the phone almost instantly gets paired there sometimes might be a slight delay of 2-3 seconds for pairing when you open the case.4. The battery inclusive of the pod and case last for about 2 and a half days when used extensively.5. Charging is quite fast with the type-C charger.6. Noise cancellation too works pretty fine.7. The fit is superb, it doesn't fall off your ears even when you ride a bike or scooty and your body jerks due to the movement.Cons:1. The major problem I faced is the connectivity, the range isnt very strong and you will face issues like choppy and laggy audio when you and your phones are 2 small rooms apart.2. Though this isn't a major issue and i faced it only once, sometimes when you use two pods separately there is an audio imbalance. For example, I took out one pod out of the box and decided to use it for 15 mins and then decided to plug in the other one into my ear after 15 mins so the 2nd pod i take out of the box doesn't plays the audio until you keep both the pods in the case close the case and reopen it.Overall, it is a good product in such a price range and I would recommend you to buy this."
"Writting thus review after using the airpodes for10 days...Its just awesome...  Initially i had a ear pain as i was using it for long ours... After a day 2 got into habit..Product wise its worth every penny...  Connectivity,  sound,  base,  water resistance, touch sensors Everything is perfect...10/10👌👌👌👌"
"Sound quality is good and seamless in connecting with mobile each time. small earbud fits well. if fits well in ears, is great and also helps noise cancellation. Can do exersice wearing it wothout any issue. Just touch is too sensitive (good sense and also bad sense), as sometimes when try to adjust pods in ear to audio/video stops instantly.But overall its great and got cheap in offer and enjoying it."

"Works well, Noise cancellation works nice. Battery also works well, after full charging it stays about 4-5 hours and the container box able to charge it around 5-8 times without getting charged.Sound quality also good."
"It's one of my fav bassbuds ever and one of the greatest bass and noise cancellation that i have ever seen, pls Don't listen at full volume, it's frequency is very high and effective, Go for it and it's full and full value for money, Greatest product ever....Boat heads #its my second collection of boat, both ones are fully satisified to me and mind blowing perfomance it is, It's very valuable at these price..."
"VERY BAD &WORST FOR CALLS. CANT HEAR VOICE AND SPEAK. AMAZON GIVES ONLY REPLACE, NO REFUNDIf you are looking for this product to be used for calling, you will be highly disappointed as speaker is of worst quality. The person on the other side of the phone cannot hear you as your voice is not clear. There are no reviews related to this feature and therefore I ordered the product. But returned it the next day itself.Sound quality is awesome only for music. Too bad for calls and specially when you are in crowd. Battery is okay, not so bad.Worst part is the rubber material in earbuds...used as a crown or fixer or whatever, 15 mins maximum and then it will start paining your ears from outside like hell. 3 hours maximum and your ears will swell from outside. It feels like barb wire connected to your outer ear.Voice quality on calls is not good. You have to speak a little louder than normal which is not feasible at most times. And there is a lot of noise on and off calls. Because of noise during calls, i had to disconnect the call in-between and talk through my phone. This is not why bought this wireless earbud. And after using it for nearly an hour, there is pain in my ears.Totally this one utter waste,no noise reduction, recipient couldn't listen our voice properly. Moreover its sound quality is really too horrible. Voice is too low and not able to listen opponent voice.VERY VERY BAD &WORST FOR CALLS. CANT HEAR VOICE AND SPEAK 😭😭😟😟😡😡"
"For an average music listener, I would say that these ear-buds are quite decent for daily use. they connect to one device at a time through Bluetooth. These earbuds fit snugly on ears and comfortable to be used for 30-45 minutes at a stretch. Battery backup of the power bank is excellent and lasts more than a week if used a couple of hours daily."
"I have been using the product fir the last 20 days now. Here is my opinion about the product. Would also like to mention that i bought made in India model which costed me Rs. 500 more1. Sound Quality is really good. Though you need to keep the sound more or less at maximum all the time. The quality of sound is really good2. Grip of the buds in the ear is really good, it doesn't fall out and I don't feel any discomfort over long hours3. Battery backup is good. I couldn't check how long it works as everytime u remove it, u need to put it back in the case and it gets recharged. However, the battery backup of the case is really good4. Sound clarity on the voice call is really really good. It's the feedback shared by people who talked to me on the earbuds5. Bluetooth connectivity is impressive. It instantly gets connected to my phone once I take it out of the phone. Range is also very impressive. I can take a voice call in another room while keeping the room closed in which the phone is placedOverall a very nice value for money buy at this price point"
After a month of using this I can say I made a good purchase.Sound Quality is decent 3/5Bass 4/5Treble 3/5Touch 3/5Battery 4/5Value for Money 5/5If anyone faces problem for left ear sound not coming just put it back into charging case and then take it off again...left piece will work again. whole process should not take more than a 5 seconds.
"The regular price is 1999 but I purchased it in 1799 when the sale was going on.Amazon delivered it on time and the packaging was ok, I mean there was not any second box making it safer though there was only polythene and then the original box itself but not the big issue here I guess.1: Talking about the product, The build quality is pretty good. It gives premium look. The case along with eardopes is not too heavy but the eardopes having satisfiable weight to feel something good quality.2: Connectivity is very fast, you just have to pair manually the first time, and then it would connect automatically within seconds after opening the case.3: Touch Sensitive button work very well but it does take a second response. Also, these buttons sometimes annoy. Like if you are just readjusting your eardopes then accidentally the touch may respond ending up pausing the music or hung up the call.4: Battery is pretty good, I use 2 to 3 hours continuously without using them and the case can be alive for up to 2 days if you are not a heavy user.Not good is that your ear will start hurting for sure if you are using them for more than 45 minutes.Pro tip: If you want to use both eardopes to different devices then connect both with one device, keep one eardope with that device and walk far away from that device taking another eardope until it disconnects. Then when it disconnects, connect it with a different device there only. Come back to your place and voila enjoy both eardopes as different Bluetooth devices."
"Best Airpods Ever !!!But talk to u in battery life , Ohh it's worst ever.Airpods Battery Boat Company Say upto 5 hr. It's ohk i mean 4 hr. Atleast play. No it's mistake Only & Only Airpods 150 min play with the single charge. I already one time replace this item but same issue create. You can better purchase to buy oneplus neckband in only 2000/- in single charge 10 min in 20 hr. Playback. I want to return this item but it's not possible .Note ::: on Photo view and can't purchase this item."
"It is a great product in this price range. Great noise cancellation and sound quality is also great. If you want bass dominated these won't do. Probably would give 3.5 stars.The left earbud though keeps falling off, I don't know whether its the ear or the earbud itself😅.Another major defect is the battery life, it doesn't last 5 hours on a single charge. Max lasting is 4-4.30 hrs. Somtimes when u use meeting apps it goes down to 3.30-45 hrs."
"The boAt Airdopes 441 are worth every penny. I gifted them last month to my brother on his birthday and he's been using it everyday since then.The sound quality, touch and noise cancellation are really good. He is an office guy and says that it's been very useful to not always have his phone with him and yet be able to talk to clients.Go ahead and buy it for you or your loved ones :)"
"Wrose qualityI don't recommended thisI am used few day after 7 day Bluetooth connectivity issue and also sound issueI am claim the warranty.In warranty they replaced me another earbuds but this that new earbuds same issue.Boat are selling only old product rejected product in quality like that I am not use. Even 10 day I don't recommended this go for any other brand.Price also high. Try another brand u will get compare this product u get it good quality products in low price like 1,500 u will get easily quality compare this."
I wanted for gym use & this serves the purpose. It doesn't fall off & is comfortable.Pros:-Good range-Good battery backup-Comfortable & doesn't fall offCons:-only one size earbud. Not sure if fits for all ear sizes-Sound quality could have been better-Touch control bit sensitive. Need to get used to
"Everything is perfect about these earphones. Bass is superb. Best in this range. A treat for music lovers. But it is a pain in the neck for calling purposes. It is tooooo sensitive. If u even touch it slightly while touching your hair or re-adjusting them a bit in your ears, it would cut the call. It does the same if you are lying in ur bed and it touches your pillow. It is also loose in my ears so I dread to wear it out. But if u are looking for music purposes, then go ahead, I feel it's the best in the range."
"After 15 minutes of use, I felt like I am packaged in a bus with no fresh air to breath..I don't know if it's my personal experience but, this earbuds goes inside your ear, block the airways to ear and you began to feel uneasy after some times, also ear hurts though it perfectly fits my ears. Sound is not crisp, you go deaf, can't hear surrounding sounds, it completely block you ears... somebody next to me will die and I wont even notice and I will probably die too."
"Pros:1. Cheapish2. Fits well in ear, no pain or sweating felt3. Sound is okayCons:1. My team reported drastic drop in my audio quality with this microphone, very low voice felt at the other end.2. Not recommended for office calls3. As battery gets low, the sync between the pods get off, so you start getting variable sounds in your ears. Felt this a couple of times. Gives you a headache.4. You simply can't drop the pods in the charger, you have to adjust it sometime to bring it charging state, which i feel is bad."
I am using this for about 15 days now. I am an huge fan of boat. I am almost using 5 products of boat. For this Product Sound Quality is good. You actually have to reduce the volume after listening for some time on high volume. Touch sensitivity is good but requires 1 second to take actions. You can use it while riding in Helmet but sometimes the listener won't be able to hear your sound while on call. Battery life is actually better than i expected. I saw the reviews that a person need to charge it after using it for a couple of hours.. Actually it is not happening in my case. Idk 😅 I have been using them for hours and then I get bored with them and you can easily put them back and let them charge. Even I haven't heard any battery low sound yet.One can purchase it..I suggest you to hear BELIEVER 8D in this.. You will be in love with these. 💕
I purchased this product on 12th Aug 2021 and within 4 months that is today 15th of Dec 2021 I I not able to hear any audio from 1 ear dope nor it is charging properly . 1 ear dope seems to be fully null because it's not providing any output nor we are able to hear anything. The company seems to assure guarantee of 1 year but it started malfunctioning withing 4months. Is this kinda commitment you provide to your customers? Being using boat products since quiet a long time this is the worst service experience I have ever had.
I brought this for my father. And you know what he said it is of my type ❤️ ! He told me about their experiences that is so amazing. He has fond of songs great legend kishore kumar 🤗. That boAt airdopes 441 is so cool in sounds and bass quality. Also it hase IP rating for real 🤩🤩🤩🤩. No more  words for it. Just buy it out 💝 You'll remember me after buying out.
"I have been using a boat roakerz 335 wireless band before, mainly for Gym workouts. However, at times during workouts, you don't really feel comfortable with the band as the ear bud keeps popping out. And there is no function controls other than changing volume, every time i have to tap next from my phone to play next song.Then ordered this one, sound quality is amazing. It comes with pre-built function, where you can change next track with a single tap, touch controls are so soft. As soon as I received the product, played 8 D, 16 D songs of A R rahman from you tube, you will definitely feel the premium sound quality.The case is so handy, easy to carry and it comes with charging cable as well. Doesn't take much time for full charge. At this price, you wouldn't find any other brand with such quality sound. Go for it, its worth it."
Again a very nice product from BOATSound quality is really good and you can feel the bass in certain songsFits perfectly in your ears and won't fall even while sprintingTouch controls work very wellYou will get used to the controls and feel in the ear in 2-3 days ( you can hardly feel them in your ears)Case is of good quality and charges the airdopes fast and the case is compact and easy to carry in your pocketsThis is a great product for daily use and working out.Don't miss this if you are getting them for under 2000 bucks
"You should definitely buy this set of earphones if you like to waste your money. Amazon doesn't take its returns and the only option we have is to exchange these. The problem is with the model, it is bad, no matter how many times you exchange it. I have never seen earphones that don't even get properly charged. Apparently only one earpiece gets charged and the other one clearly doesn't fit the case well. Lights don't work on one of the earpieces. I replaced it for these two reasons but the new one shows the same problems. The microphone is terrible. I am blown by the fact that this product has a 4-star rating. It's not even worth half its advertised price in my opinion. Boat's quality is usually good but this model is bad by all means."
"I was apprehensive of these before i bought them. But as soon as I put them in my ears, all my doubts vanished into thin air.*How's the fit? - Couldn't be more secure; be it headbanging to heavy metal or a long run. The buds won't budge, not at all.* The battery life seems to be too good to be true, is it? - You get exactly what you see. The battery life is a banger. You can listen to these on long hikes and runs, without the fear of not being able to charge them.* Is the sound quality good enough? - boAt does say 'NIRVANA', right!?* Will it be able to handle sweaty workouts? - IPX7 rating!! Just took a long shower in these and couldn't be any happier. If it can handle a full on shower, then don't you worry about your sweat.For the discounted price of 2500, it feels like i have cheated boAt out of the money that they so rightfully deserved."
"Not worthyReviewing this product after 2 months of usageFirst I received a product with low battery issues, then product was replacedInitially the product was good but later days 1 of the buds stopped charging and joy working.Noise cancellation is also not working, while speaking other person was hearing my tv sound rather than my voice even though my television was 6ft away from me."
Terrific pair of TWS. Sound quality is great. It's not just the bass but you can hear other musical instruments very well too. At this price point it is totally worth the buy. Have had no issues while making calls or attending Zoom meetings either.
"Using from 3 months, no issues found.Sound quality- Good enough when you try to buy in rhat price range.Base is quite highBluetooth Connectivity- Easy and quick.** No dual device connection ** - You can not connect airdopes with two devices at a time.Battery- Best, I am using around 2 hours in a day with one time buds charging.Charging case- Best, I charge case in a month.You can get difficulty when you used your helmet"
"Okay here comes another review from an average Joe to all his like minded relatives. To start with I was very hesitant to buy after those scary reviews but thankfully everything is smooth till now.  This was the fastest delivery by Amazon till now.To all those struggling between budget and quality, these buds stay true to the word 'decent'. These got some crazy bass while the drivers are bit small, thus throws off the balance between loudness, clarity and bass. But if you are only concerned with music more than anything you will just adapt to it. Noise is good enough to neglect someone's call for help. It feels quite awkward to pick calls in public with the inauspicious color. There is a hypocrite mention of being waterproof ipx7 and also avoid going near water, so some daredevil trying to use them in shower please do reply me."
"Totally unworthy of its price. I've seen cheaper wired earphones far better than this.- There is always a horrid, loud, running static (Geiger counter-type) noise on both buds. It ruins everything.(and yes, I returned and replaced it, the static problem never goes away)- One of the two buds will randomly stop working for no reason. Even if there is no fault of the user.- If you're on an Android phone, it loves to trigger the Google Assistant and stop whatever you were listening to every few minutes, unless you sit still and motionless.- For all that trouble, you get very average quality of sound at best.Using Boat Airdopes is a painful experience and buying this was a complete waste of money.Don't buy garbage from Boat, go for other earpieces."
"Overall the product is beast, In this range getting this quality in mindblowing. However i fan of boat products and i have a speaker and headphones to.Comming to this airdopes 441Pros :1.The sound quality , bass , everything is simply superb.2 They are very light weight3. Great battery backup4. Look will impress you5. Noise cancellation is remarkableCons1. When i use these airdopes with the grip they have given it hurt my ears a lot. So i will use them without that grip.This is the only thing which i didnt like"
"Such wonderful earbuds and that too for ₹1.8k. Fit is smooth and firm, can take them out for running. Calls are not a problem and the buds connect to the phone the moment you open the case lid. All that in Size of a palm."
"you can use it for small duration. for heavy or long duration use don't buy it . also you need to remove that fins else will cause pain in ear due to that, after removing fins it looks bad but becomes comfortable. i return the product  after 3 days as i cant use while wearing helmet it will break connection, even if you bring hand or any other body part during yoga or exercise near your ear, it will break connection, connectivity range is also  very bad. one thing i am impress is with Amazon service. i got best service ever. they made return on my request when i explained not comfortable for my ears, even after only replacement policy was there they considered exeption case and made full refund. love amazon. i have some very bad experience from reliace digital big fraud company."
"I use it only during my workout and it works absolutely fine. The battery backup is too good. The sound output is also reasonably good. You cannot compare them with JBL/Sony/Bose headphones, but overall you will be happy with the product"
Good sound as always boat provide.....Bass is good... Nice trendy look and nice fit... Charging case have enough battery back up which last whole week.....Custom service is also excellent... You need to register your product after purchase.... Quick response from service Team.It's really nice pods with excellent sound... Definitely you can go for it... I am using same from 2 month's.
"Voice call quality is good, built quality is robust but cant use beyond 20 minute . some how inside of ear pains after long use. you have to readjust and then can use it for 20 minute. some erganomic issue. Noise cancellation is decent due to design (have tested it at ariport). I was impressed with voice quality and use it mostly for calls . It amazes how it captures voice through ear piece . its a good standalone system when you dont want wired mess but not a long term solution"
"Five stars to the product, because it is is total value for money at 2k. Even though I have thoroughly used and felt the product, I will give a simple review divided into pros and cons from a layman's viewpoint.Pros-Sweet highs and lows in treble,  enough to make you enjoy the music.Deep, smooth bass that is adequate and does not mask much the treble, unlike many reviewers have mentioned.Comfortable in the ear and firm, provided you don't push too hard or the wings will hurt your ears.Decent battery backup, for me it lasted around 5.5 hours on first time full charge, used continuously for music, gaming and streaming.Type C charging, meaning Samsung phone users don't need to carry an extra cable.Both earbuds can be used separately, mono - helpful if you want to speak while doing something as well as hear things around you, perhaps while on an MMORPG game talking to your teammates.Touch controls, make it easy to navigate while listening to music, easy to pause and play back again.Water resistant to an appreciable extent, a nice walk in the rain with music in your ears.Enjoyable experience while playing music - tried on Shakira, Skrillex, Coldplay, Major Lazer, Avicii, Alan Walker, Imagine Dragons and Linkin Park apart from normal Bollywood as well as Tollywood songs.No protrusion at the bottom, like other earbuds. Just plain, simple and they nail the job.Cons-The earbud wings could hurt if you put them on too hard in your ear.Touch controls need to get used to a bit, since you're essentially pressing on your ear for advanced controls in the earbuds like voice assistant etc.Rugged, matte look - looks rough and not that glossy. A better paint job maybe?You will need to charge the earbuds box at least once every two days to make sure there is enough juice for your listening experience (may vary on individual usage).They look a little bulky in your ears, not that unnoticeable.Not that much noise canceling, but enough for daily usage on calls as well as music or gaming.Overall, very much happy with the product - packing, quality and the overall experience. Only difference between this model and the pro is the larger battery capacity in the box for the Pro model, which is really not necessary unless you know you will be out with no access to charging for 5-6 days perhaps. Great packaging as well as the shopping experience thanks to Amazon."
"I've been using this product for 3 months noe and thought I should post an overall review.1. The sound quality here is really good. Although I gave a 4 star, cause there's always room for improvement.2. There's no complaint about battery. Once paired, the bluetooth earphones run continuously for 5-6 hours without any hassle (less time for music and more for calling feature). Also, once completely drained, the fully charged case can charge the earphones 100% in just a matter of minutes. And due to type-C charging, the case doesn't take much time to charge as well.3. Poor bass, only 2 star for that. But then be realistic, such a small item cannot provide you higher bass. If you prefer bass more than anything, do not havr high hopes while buying this item. For me, the bass is perfect.4. Noise cancellation is pretty good. I often get chappal from my mom for not listening to her at all. Helps you go through boring lectures as well.5. Sometimes, there's a minor connectivity issue. I don't really know why this is happening, but it usually doesn't bother me much cause it gets solved by putting the earphones in the case."
"These earbuds are MARVELOUS, Like before these I had the boat airdopes 381 and lost themm due to some reason, and I was honestly not very satisfied with that one, after that my sister got the realme buds q and they had amazing sound quality but the bass didn't feel upto the mark and it has some damn connection issues. Then I bought these and they are so freaking good, The sound quality is super great, equal or better maybe than realme buds q and the bass is over powered, and plus these look so damn good too! I've got the red ones btw! The leds are BEAUTIFUL, They look great, they sound great, the bass is fuging great and the fitting too is great, This one is a life changerr, definitly go for it, its completely fine if you dont even consider other ones, these will leave you with no regeret, the battery life is pretty good too, 5-6 hours on an average, and they charge QUICK, Like holy damn QUICK, 20 minutes in the case and you can be back to whatever u wanna do! Not for gaming btw! These are just marvelously great, they connect to your phone within 3 seconds after you open the case and if ur bluetooth is on, a very few times u might face one of them or both not working, it happens maybe once in 4 months, just turn off your bluetooth on the phone, put them in the case, close it, open it again, and tap both of them 3 or 4 times continuously, blue and green lights will blink and boom, they bd working again! These are some very good shit, go for it!"
"I have been using these earphones for past 10 days and I wish to give my honest review. I ordered these after searching for quite a while and the initial quality was amazing, but after using them for a couple of days it started getting disconnected with my phone. Thinking it might be the phone issue, I tried with another phone but it kept on happening. The voice started to flicker and the connection is not proper.Checked the return policy and Amazon replaced the unit but even the replacement unit is having the same issue. I would like to raise a complaint and get refund for these earphones."
"Writing aftr a long usage ..after months.. Battery last but connectivity is extremely poor.. voice sounds like you are inside a empty room or inside water all times. If there is connectivity, then the chances of getting your audio without breaks to the other caller is rare. But you had hear the other caller clearly.. charging case connectivity is loose. And it needs to be carefully handled. It might break."
"Ordered these 2-3 days back. Delivery was quick as these were delivered next day ( may be because of the local seller). Sound quality is excellent. Bass and noise cancellation is amazing at given price range. The only issue which i am facing is the battery backup. On full charging the ear-buds, they give backup of 2 hours max, give or take few minutes.Ordered for the replacement. Lets see if their is any change."
"Well, to start with this Airdope is definitely worth the money. At a price point of 2000-2500, it does a decent job. They are light ,easy to to pair and use.It's extremely bass heavy, so if you are found of Bass this is definitely a no brainier. At medium volume levels sound quality is clear amd balanced. The microphone is average.Anyone expecting a super quality audio experience,  you may want to buy products in the range of 10k and above."
"Using the product since one year, Noise cancellation is worst, however sound quality is good even battery backup is upto satisfaction level.When it comes to noise cancellation, people on the other side complaining they can even hear the noise of ceiling fan, and out doors don't have to mention specifically"
"First of all kudos to Solid built quality.Used it for  around 2weeks. Heres 10points i have to say about this boat earpodes.1.Im a mediocre bass lover and bass quality in this is  totally fine for people like me. Not outstanding like you get from wired headsets. But enjoyable.2.I didnt bought this for calls but damn call quality is pretty decent than i expected.👍kudos for that.3.Tried call of duty and yes slight latency is there,about like a millisecond lag or two.3.Getting used to controls was hard.4.Sweat, water, & side of helmet can pause or change music when came in contact with the touchpad.5.I used it while showering and it worksfine. Even though water can trigger the touch controls when came in contact.6. Dont dip it in water tho. Its risky.7.when you pause the music from earpods, Suddenly sound goes high for a millisecond and returns to normal but only rarely. Maybe issue with my product or phone.8.FITS PERFECTLY IN EAR9.THE LIGHTS ARE SO COOL.10.BATTER BACK UP IS DECENT. I USE IT WHEN TRAVELING ON BUS, WALKING, OR AT NIGHT,5-10SONGS PER USE. NEVER RAN OUT OF CHARGE ON EARPODES.  CASE CAN CHARGE EARPODES 4 TIMES. IN SHORT CHARGINGS, CASE BATTERY LASTS 2 DAYS."
"Surprised... I ordered it a day ago n received it today.. superfast..Well i receiveda.3pairs of extra earbudsb. Type c cablec. Manuald. Warranty carde. CatalogueOfcourse with ""airdope""Edit: its been 15-20days of purchase n useEars started paining after putting these on for more than 15min.Changed the size of ear buds n it doesn't help..Stopped using these now.. 🥺☹️"
Hv been using these for 1 month now.Not a heavy user . Max 4-5 hrs per week.Sound quality is ok. But cant use for voice callls as other side wont get voice properly.Major issue is that one of ear piece stops working randomly though touch control still stay alive but you won't hear any thing.So over all a poor product.Better you avoid it.
"I got it with an expectation but my left airdopes doesn't wrk at all...Please consider and change my order pack or refund my amount I may reorder someother brand eardopes...It's 2,500/ I paid and no good response from u people....After two days of my purchase the airdopes r not wrking...Not of so user-friendly...Alws getting sensored by itself.Please change my piece of airdopes or allow me to order another model of aidpes.Really heard good about ur company and ordered my airdopes.npw really fed up of ur qualityAlso no response of it.please reply soon..."
I bought these on Diwali and got them for an amazing price of 15K which was a great deal and was budget friendly .The sound of these earbuds is great and balanced and bass quality is also awesome. I haven't used Boat products before but I loved these and recommend everyone to go for it blindly.After using for so months I am facing a little bit unnecessary sound from the left earbud but it doesn't spoiled the quality of music and they are also working fine.Battery backup is also great in these earbuds I got at least 2 days of charge after charging the case but it also depends how you use it.At last I would say that a great earbuds at this cost is just fine.
"Totally satisfied with sound quality on each Small Medium Large tips you'll hear sufficient deep bass. Very very nice material quality. You'll surely identify the premiumness of sound.My Experience- Nice, Comfortable and Very Lightweight Buds(Literally you'll forget after sometime that this buds is in your ears)- Heavy Bass Boosted Experience. (Personally I like the most)- Very Responsive Touch Controls.- Attractive Ring Lights ( I loved this)- Not falling off from your ears at any cost.- Magnetically placed in CaseBass and EDM lovers surely you can buy this."
This boat 441 ear buds are quite badass. The sound quality is excellent with superb bass. Battery backup is excellent goes up for 4 hrs with single charge. I got this for 1599 if you get this for higher prices please wait for some sale you will definitely get it on low price.
It is really good and when i am travelling through highway even while sitting on a Royal Enfield and passing from fast winds you still can clearly listen to the music just the bass is slightly too much but you can adjust them using an app or from your music setting configuration but over all its noise cancellation quality and battery performance is upto the mark and i am enjoying it.
"The boAt 441 is just amazing. Unmatched sound quality. Bass is next level. And at the price that amazon is offering it at (2499.00) it's a steal deal. I feel brands like Bose, Jabra and so many other top brands that price their airpods at over 10k are just hyped and unjustified. The boAt 441 can easily give them a run for their money."
The battery backup is really amazing. I brought the airdopes in december and till date i haven't charged the whole case even once. The sound quality is good. A special note: if using for calls try to talk in a quiet place as the eardopes do not have ANC so even the slightest sound is heard. Else the product is good. Because extra earbuds and ear support is given it becomes easy to fit any size of ear. Using for a long period like 5 hrs can cause pain in the ears. But overall great product. Would rate it 4.3 out of 5.
Everything was perfect including the sound quality and bass. But the important feature that is lagging is the battery backup. I used it at 100℅ volume the left ear lasts for around 150 minutes and the right ear for around 115 minutes. But the company claims for upto 5 hrs. So considering the efficiency to be around 72-75 ℅ it should at least last for around 3.5 hrs. But it failed.
"There are many aspects to rate truly wireless earphones, out of which 441pro performed decent to well in most aspects. They're comfortable, gives pretty good sound quality and decent bass performance.The only 2cons that made me return the earphones are1. High latency/lag during gaming. I could observe a very minor latency while watching Netflix on mobile.2. Touch sensitive buttons are not so responsive and some times the song gets paused for like no Reason."
"Oye hoye, mza aa gya.. i already have neckband of boat. I used jbl headphones also. Now these 441 airdopes are awesome. Clear vocals and powerful bass.beautiful box, three different size pair of earbuds. Charging cable.Battery backup on single charge ( i watched a 2.5 hour movie ) and 60% remaining.Small and beautiful charging case.Perfectly fits in ear.Go for it blindly if you are a music lover.Boat is really awesome."
"Just go for it, few months back people faced problems with the left earbud but it's all fixed now , I received perfect productQuality is really good , it feel premiumThe sound quality is also really good , clear loud and the bass is really good .I was really doubtful about the range but the connectivity range is really good , definitely more then 10m , about 15mThe only issue is call quality, if you looking for earbuds for calling, this isn't for you but other then calling , it's the best , go for it 100%"
I bought this pro and use it almost  5 days  I must tel u it amazing product I charge only at once when it arrived and use daily but battery can’t show low signal it’s very nice battery life beautiful sound quality and very light weight it connects with your ph or any device just when u open this cute small case sound quality was amazing like theatre feel
Amazing product for the price.My advice go for any true wireless but it should have a secure fit feature so that it does not fall off.At the same time also check if you are comfortable with something pressing in your ears as these sometimes ache if you wear it for a long duration of time.Sound quality is amazing there is no issue in listening to music.Calling is also perfect you have clear conversation on phone.Noise cancellation is also perfectOnly thing is you cannot control volume.Size is amazingly small but sufficient and easy to carry in pocket.The charger is slightly tight. You have to press it hard all the way inside other wise it will not charge.One small issue for iPhone users is you will not have a fast charger of 2A so it may take longer time to charge if you do not have any other charger. So please take this into account.I have tried wearing it for a very long time and my advice take a break for after 1/1.5 hours to let your ears rest.
"It has been 6-7 months since I have had these. So many issues , the touch doesn’t work effectively. They are supposed to disconnect from the device if they are charging but it just stays connected , and the battery keep draining. The sound quality is bearable at the most. And this is the one I received after I sent back the first one in which you could hear a buzz through out . Not a good buy. My previous Bluetooth earphones worked for almost 2 years, this purchase is quite a disappointment."
I received a faulty piece as the right ear buds charge holding capacity was very low initially and now it doesn't power On at all. Left ear buds touch function doesn't work properly. I have sent numerous emails not getting proper response in terms of service or replacement I have been following no updates so far. Boat customer service number doesn't work either always busy. After sales support and service is really pathetic and appalling. I would strongly not recommend based on my experience pathetic and appalling customer experience.
"Long story short - I'm lovin it.Got myself a BoAt airdopes 441 Pro on 26th Oct sale costing me 2250 INR and got it delivered the next day. I like classic black colour so don't judge those pics.Now let's go see in detail what i got at this price -A charging case with 2500mAH capacity -  came in 75% charged in box.  case has the left(L) and right(R) pods mentioned, glad to see this small detail from BoAt.A flat wire USB-C cable roughly 1 ft in length (top right in pic).3 pairs of SML ear plugs. 1 extra M sized plug is affixed to earpods itself.1 extra pair of rubber sleeve (top left in pic). Really mindful of BoAt to include an extra pair.Now let's talk about the real issues.Build and visuals -Earpods are made of plastic but sturdy and feel well made.Pods look quite small in size at first but are heavier once placed in your ears. Heaviness takes its toll gradually on your ears and you may feel it all the time.The EarPods are bit slippery when clutched in fingers and may fall if not handled properly.Touch surface is decorated with RGB lighting and looks awesome.Material of provided sleeves and eartips is also of good quality and soft to touch.Charging case is a bit bulkier compared to basic model given larger battery size. The flap (top lid) I felt to be a bit flimsy compared to entire case, could have been a bit heavier.Usage -The EarPods are rated at 35mAH each with a usage time of 5 hours playback. I have been using it non-stop at 50-60% sound output and for me it has lasted for more than 5 hours in continuous usage.Touch controls are good addition as it eases a lot of operational headaches however response could be a bit better. I found that after pausing the music I could put my hands down easily before playback was actually paused.You can use each EarPod separately and it is able to function on its own for both music and calls.Call quality is actually quite decent which was a bit surprising for me for such price range.Controls are simple -  Single touch for play/pause and receiving calls (any ear).  Double touch left earpod for previous, right for next and any of them for ending call.  Long press for deactivate/shutdown the EarPods.EarPods feedbacks with ringtones when turning on/off or (un)pairing.They automatically get disabled after a few minutes if disconnected.Could not muster up courage to test IPX7 water proofing but if any brave soul can muster up the courage, put your results here. :PSound/Music QualityGreat, for this price range). I have been using MI In-ear pro wired headset for last 3 years and it’s comparable to that with better bass.It’s a bit Bass heavy but hey most of us like that, don’t we ;)Sound  I found a bit muffled and soft when on call but everything was clear for communication.RangeHaven’t tested range of 10 meters in open area but indoors could at most walk 3 meters with wall(s) in between. I found sound to be breaking when beyond 2 walls (6 in thick).Still need to check call quality in open and loud areas. Will do that once out of house at a busy hour.As a general user, so far I have found the airdrops 441 pro to be of my liking. I hope you will also feel the same.The star rating on Amazon does not do justice to this product and should be between 4 and 4.2 stars.Go for it. Its a very good choice for casual users at this price range."
"I ordered 4 Airdopes 441 in a single orderFrom that 2 was not working properlyBluetooth was not recognized when I tried first timeI tried resetting a lot. After multiple tries, Bluetooth name displayed and connected.But the right year side device is not working.Same issue for 2 devices from the ordered 4 devices.There is no refund. Only replace option. That’s a big mess.If somebody is willing to buy this productDouble check everything when u receive.Do check all the possibilities.Sound quality is perfect and Mic is really greatBass is not that muchIf someone is going to purchase an item, do prefer FLIPKART. Customer support of Amazon is bad while comparing with Flipkart. U will get refund option also.I am using Boat Airdopes 402 for long time and there is connectivity issue when I make calls. If I stand somewhere and listen to songs, there is no issueBut if I walk, it will be disconnected. I don’t know why such an issue with Airdopes"
"I was using boat products for last three years now. But this one was very disappointing. It did not connect well with either my laptop or my mobile. The sound quality was good but connectivity issue ruined my experience. I recommend we should avoid this product.But the best part was how Amazon handled the return process. Though lockdown was there and situation was bad out there, the entire process vor return and refund was very smooth and very professionally handled. I am associated with Amazon for long time now, and it's really good to have such an organisation around."
"What a bad product man.This promises like alot lot,but when when you actually get it and start using you feel how bad quality one can deliver.Range is bad,bass is worse,sound quality is bad.and still you can recover from these, because to be honest you actually paid eay less then other options,still connevtivity? It just disconnects like ramdom,while you're playing some music on your connected device and you haven't moved an inch since last 2 3 hours.Why produce and market such device then. My advice..if you can manage such disconnecticity then go for it.but if not,spend better like the way i should had."
"I've been using these harshly for years. Still worked fine for 8 months, but then eventually one side was discharging faster than the other and the mic wasn't up to expectation since the beginning I think but sound is great.After 8 month I filed a complaint at boat website and got totally fresh product again. Seems better than last one. Hoping this works for 8 months too. Going to Be a boat head. It's awesome.Update : Earbud replacement not working right."
I got replaced one against the previous but with the same nois problem in left bud. In left bud It sounds ( like durdarshan tune) bip for some time when ever it connects to the device that is my mobile and it also sounds like that on the starting of any vedio or audio. So after using two different 441 i can surely say that all of the boat ear dops might be defective. And main thing is that this product is fulfilled by amazon. So you can think what the Amazon fulfilled products might be. This product really does not justify the price. You might get it at more lower price but as per me it is not worth at all.
No noise cancellation. Whenever in travelling the receiver party hears only noise.
"The only problem is the ""Mic Problem"" basically when you are driving (in a speed of 10km/h or more) the mic starts making problem, the person whom you are talking to unable to hear what you are saying. There is also one problem is that the box is little SLIPPERY around 5-6 times it was slipped by my hand but thankgod to it's plastic quality. Overall the airdopes are good in quality, good sound, looks good in ear."
Nice Airdopes by boAtBass quality is goodSound quality is goodOn call sound quality is goodNoise cancellation works wellWorks within 10-15m distanceHas 6mm dynamic driver with IPX7Use Bluetooth 5.0 with IWP (Instant Wake and Pair Technology)Has a premium look..NOTE :-# You can also use boAT case as power bank for mobile charging (but use only in case of Emergency) #Product warranty is for 1 yearGive 1 Sec sound lag while playing PubG
"1. Very good sound quality with extremely nice bass.2. Premium look.3. Long lasting battery and gets quickly charged.4. IWP technology is absolutely fantastic, if your Mobile's Bluetooth is on and you open the box , it will automatically get connected. If your music player has a setting of 'Play songs automatically as soon as Bluetooth is connected', you will be able to listen songs immediately.5. LED indicators on battery changes its colors depending on the % remaining6. Very light weight box and airpods.7. Type-C charging point."
"All Good, attractive, you can use one bud as stand alone for calls.Power standby and usage hours also good enough, almost I have not recharged it for more once per month, I am using it for more than 3 months.Only concern is on wearing this for long hours, ears are paining. For short hours less than hour it's fine."
"I have used them for a week or so and I must say it's a good product overall at this price range. The build quality is good, material is good. The airdopes fit into your ear nicely, gives good grip in the ear and will not fall off easily. Very Comfortable, won't fell pain in ears even if using for long hours.The overall sound quality is also very good ( not the best but good), the bass quality is great but sometimes overpowers lows and mids. Call clarity is also good. The other person might get a bit noise when in heavy traffic or very windy area.Connectivity is also good. But after 10m distance you might get disruption in connection.The battery back up is also decent enough. The battery of airdopes lasted for 3 hrs or so and the case gave additional charge of around 3 to 3.5 times."
Best airdope on best price. Got it in lighting deals @1799. Battery backup is awesome. I am using in Samsung phone which has Dolby sound feature which enhances if the sound quality. No problem will using for a long duration comfortable. Its China made. that's the drawback. Boat should start manufacturing its products in India.
"Bought this product after reading reviews here.Turned out the first one stopped working after a week and Amazon sent a replacement ,the other stopped workng after 20 days and since then I am struggling to get service done in lockdown.After the product was picked up for service ,a lower quality product is delivered..Still waiting to use this.been a pathetic experience reaching out nd Amazon is nt taking responsibility after Return window is shut"
Bass:- super powerfull can believe 6mm can perform this wellI use so many expensive TWS.... this perform same as those... Base lover its for you!!Fitting:- very good 5 out of 5Battery:-  excellent...Charging:- cant tell much...2hr for case...and 40 min for podsFinal verdict:- 2500rs--> go for it.... excellent TWS...very comfortable....didnt fall off while i was running dancing... Range is impressive....I got it for 2500rs on Great Indian sale
Great packaging within 2 days delivery and ultimate quality of design sound and features spacially power bank features never let you down in emergency situationsOnly issue is the latency in the gamesOtherwise it is best in class rich bass punchy treble and clear vocalsHats off to the Boat Team
"Seriously mannn in that first 5 minutes right after I got this in ma hands, I'm impressed for this price points it's over performing....Go for itBut somewhat big case lol"
Never expect this kind of service from Amazon.. first time left earbud was not working..thn i released it and after got new one this time right earbud is not working properly..how irritating this is...Is anybody in Amazon who are concerned about all these irresponsible services..This is my first bad review..i never wrote bad...but this was birthday gift..but Amazon already destroyed this feeling..
"Believe me, you will not find a better one in this price. This is an independent buyer view. Despite of anti-china made wave in country I had to go for it due to budget constraint. In this low price range, the sound quality , range of bluetooth connectivity, technical specifications can only be fullfilled by boAT. One of the USP is the Capacitive Touch Control. Its sensitive & it distinguish between one tap vs two taps vs 3 taps very  intelligently.  Noise cancellation is very effective. Bike riders are recommended to use one bud while riding as you will not hear anything. I felt that voice is little less clear on phone calls (specially when you are moving or walking or running) as people on call ask to repeat what I speak but then its 4 out 5 times work really perfect. Go for it if you are planning a ear bud experience in low price. Charging time is 3.5-4 hours for full charge and continuously it runs for approx 5 hours including music and calls. It fits very well in ears if you are an adult. It comes with a C type cable and additional buds as per different ear size so can be used by kids. 100% phone volume will make you feel like you are experiencing a home theatre or a DJ club."
"This airport of Vote is very good, ears are very comfortable, their sound quality is very good, the base is boosted and the battery is very good, along with the charging type C which is also a very good thing. After 6 months, the airport on the left has deteriorated, its battery is low, but I have put it in warranty, so it is just a little bit that it is not lacking in the rest of the product"
"I learnt  a lesson and i am sharing my experience here, so that someone can benefit from it. Atlast no-one can make all mistakes himself to learn a lesson.Before reading my review, please note that i am an audiophile, loves trying different kinds of headphones, earphones with varying tech like wireless, wired or combination of both. I always go for good brands, but this time some person suggested me and i was having low budget and needed some day-to-day headphones.Now note :1. You would never need the advertised big 2600 mAh battery for so called EMERGERNCY purposes to charge your phone, and when i say never, i mean it. I thought of same, never used it for that purpose ever. So if that big advertisement of big battery and 150hours of charging was one point for buying it, cross it out.2. Sturdy, yes they are composed from good quality of PLASTIC, and i mean they are lightweight so even if you drop them from 33,000 feet, they won't break. But i guess you are not planning to put it under hydraulic press anyways.3. Not good bass or doesn't make different pitches or notes sound that much clear. Average on that point.4. BIGGEST DRAWBACK IS THE DESIGN OF PRODUCT AND SOFTWARE USED. See when you buy a wireless earphone you expect it to use without much involvement of your hands right. Now with this product, the accidental touches makes the listening experience far worse, they pause the song in between even if the surface gets touched by a blanket of your pocket cloth. Not that touch sensitive. Very poor software design. It makes the listening experience a wrecker.5. Now coming to the last point that they stay in ear with their ERGONOMIC DESIGN, poor claim....believe me they won't stay in your ear if your are planning for gym or running.I would say invest some more money and go for good brand like skullcandy, sony, jabra. Please don't fall for the advertisements.PS: boat become popular cause of low per capita income and it offers very poor quality. While in brands like sony, skullcandy, jabra...they invested years and years to have that kind of experience. It the years that you would pay for to buy their product and you will definitely notice the difference."
"I Have bot this Product last week, packaging was good and design was but, i lately recognized it as my voice is very poorly audible to the receiver of my calls, by the time i recognize it my option to return this product got disabled.I mainly took this product for hand free calling, but my voice is very low, breaks and poorly audible to the other person.I request for return of this product."
"Great product, compared to others, the mic’s sound catching quality is great. Don’t have to shout and talk like the other products in the market. My dog bit the box and one airdope was in her mouth. Washed it with water. Still it works like new. I love it. A recommended buy."
a very good product in price range. I got it in 1999 and 10% card discount. so a very good deal.regarding sound its average. noise cancellation should have been better. its not bad either.for music and videos its good and battery backup too is fantastic.i loved these so much that I ordered two more for my parents as these are so easy to configure and use.no pain after constant usage of 2 hours. during workout also fitting is proper.
"Starting with sound quality, it's pretty good, bass is not evenly balanced but can be managed with volume. Talking of battery backup, it performed way better than my expectations. It can function for more than 20 hours if used efficiently. Touch is too sensitive also it can't control volume. For that one has to use mobile or smartwatch. Volume control is an essential function which is missing in airdopes 441. Connectivity is great, it can work within the range of 6 to 8 m. Bluetooth actually means good coverage and it's fulfilled in here. I also faced a latency of 500ms while gaming and using social media. It looks cool something boAt is known for. In short, it's worth buying."
The sound of this earbuds is awesome .But I recommend don't buy it.Its have audio latency issue .You can't play any game by using this earbuds . ......And if you want to return this itemEven Amazon don't respond you.(poor return service)After using 6 monthsMy right earbud Stopped workingAnd it's bettery back up changed from 4h to 30mint😕Totally Waste product don't buy it !!!!!!!😠Totally Waste product don't buy it !!!!!!!😠Even in 1st week this earbuds rubber band will loose and start falling off when you try use ... This sucks .#wasteofmoney#audiolatencyissue#6monthsusedreview
Returning the product due to many consPro- Sound is good but not too loud. Bass was OK.Cons- 1- Next person on call was able to hear low sound during call2- My left earbud gave very small buzz noise when no music was played which felt irritating3- I charged the case completely to 100% and used it for 2 days for a total of 10-15 hours but the case showed less than 25% battery which is not appropriate to the claim of 150 hours4- Fit is not that good maybe for my ear size.Note: Use the case as a powerbank only when it too necessary as it is mentioned in the manual.Use 10 W charger to charge the case.
"I have used this product since 1 month and i could say that a i am quite satisfied with the airpods for calling its an average product but for music, movies its awesome.. The bass is quite good.. Not for those who have small ears.. Mark my word. it gives you a 2.5 to 3 hours of backup while calling and 3.5 to 4 hours if listening to music or watching movies.. The case is 500 mah so u can chare it 3to 5 times more that's great.Cons: 1. No volume control 2. No number is said while incoming calls"
"Seriously I thought it was a cool one in the begining, must say it look cute and stylish BUT, I must say it's showa all the qualities of a chinese made gadget, I have been using it for1 month and few days, . The right side Airbud looses it's charge quickly... I kept it inside the case for 1 whole day and even the case was fully charged and still it dint give me even 1 hour play back time.And must say their customer services just make you go craziee... No one picks up the call, and they don't reply back properly for the mail. Finally I got them n Insta."
The sound quality varies upon different smartphones.Don't blame the product if having bad quality or low quality sound.I have OnePlus 7t and the sound is really amazing.. not life wired earphones bt the difference is really not major.
My review is after using the product for more than a week.Pros## The build quality of dopes and our case is superb it feels premium and sturdy. Now comiy to Airdopes the sound quality is really owsome with amazing bass and vocals are also clear you can not feel any distortion or sound lagging.They also stay fit inside ears. The music play time Ka 2hours and 40 minutes to 3 hours and same applies to call Quality with case the range goes up to 20 hours .Cons## play time and call time could have been better like 3:30 to 4 hours .Another drawback I found is its sensitive capacitive touch button even by change of you slightly touch the button the call gets disconnected or the music stops .I think a dedicated button is butter than touch button. Over all value for money .Go for it if you can manage 3 hours playback and call time .
Loved it amazing stuff as usual by boat.just amazingOnly thing is it's microphone is not that great but for 2500 go for it.
"At this price range I don’t think you can buy anything better than this. I have Bose sound sport, this one has a sound quality equivalent to it despite being one third of it’s price. Hi for it without any doubt. The bass is superb and battery backup is awesome. Kudos to BOAT 🤘🏼"
"i hv using this earplug last 10 days.earlier i have use boat rocker 255 ,mi earphone,audio techniqu earphone.This product has good sound quality ,very smooth bess very nice with music & movies lover,nice nc,very good bettry back up almost 12 day is full charge (buds& case).my daily use is 2 hours in day.built quilty is good not premium or not look cheap.Now some problem that i obeseved.Earbuds r bit heavy. its may  feel on your ear In my experience .you can not hold long on ear as my older earphone are not TWL but those r very comfortable with ear.Company need to make it lighter weight for more comfortable."
"I was really sceptical on what airdopes should I go for, since there were loads of mixed comments for various types of truly wireless ones.. But this one is just superb and considering the price, this one just makes it a must buy if someone is looking for a good quality airdopes... Bass is superb and extremely clear, every sound, every highs and lows are crystal clear... A must buy.."
"I've tried air pods, power beats, jabra and tron.These have been the most confortable and easies to fit.Sound quality is great. Not as good as power beats but they are a lot more comfortable and havent fallen even once.Battery is solid and so is connectivity. Although sometimes it stays connected despite being in the box."
"Sound quality is awesome crisp and clear,the bass is more good than what you expected before buying.the touch operating thing is cool,I really loved built quality can use roughly,the size is totally fine for me as they provided adjustable grips and tip buds, battery is too good as it gives playtime for more hours"
"*UPDATED*GOT A REPLACEMENT PAIR.THEYRE WORKING EXCELLENT, NO LAGS, NO CONNECTION ISSUES, NOTHING,PACKAGE WAS DELIVERED THE NEXT DAY ITSELF.HOPE THEY WORK FOR A LONG TIME NOW.**UPDATED**"
"The only tws earbuds you should buy. Best in class in any terms. Battery,sound quality,noise cancellation,....just Bluetooth gaming lag and ok performance ...but I prefer wired once for gaming as this are just media once. But ignore gaming experience they are the best . Even comparing 24000 airpodes .... The best . Really a very long battery life. Absolute beast by boat."
"Overall a great buy. The sound quality is very good.Pros:1. Sound: Crisp clear.2. Bass: Very good!3. Build quality: No doubt its great.Con:Only con I found was the touch being very responsive, you end up disconnecting the calls or pausing the music unintentionally sometimes. (may get used to it after using it for a while).Really a great buy.. Value for Money!"
"so i am a student and mostly use them to watch lectures /other media  and some music in between .....i have been using boat since my 1st year in college , going from wired to wireless to truly wireless now with airdopes and gotta say, they have never disappointedperhaps one downgrade(not exactly if u use only 1 device) is that my boat rockerz 261 used to be connected to both my devices simultaneously and i could use it for whatever device i was using but this one only connects to 1 at a time which means i need to disconnect and reconnect againthats how less cons i could find in this that i have bring something more of a personal issue to go against it....just buy it if u are looking for a truly wireless experience at this price point"
"Excellent, Awesome, Marvellous etc etc. I was searching for Best Earbuds with a small budget and almost two months I have searched in Flipkart and Amazon, Read Product reviews of So many but Sony, jabra, Philips all are very expensive, Finally search ends with two Brands i.e Boult and Boat then again started reading reviews both the Brands and everybody wrote about Boat and Finally purchased Boat Airdopes 441 TWS and using for almost 25 days, Its Amazing about Sound Quality, Bass,Mobile back up etc etc. Little bit disappointed because my friend purchased after seen using me during Dussehra Amazon sale he got it for Rs1999 and 25 days back I purchased it Rs-2299. Thanks to both Amazon and Boat for providing such a nice and efficient product with this Price. Best part is its very useful for work from home, Which I needed. Thanks"
"So much of Audio latency, Connection Problem and also no great Battery Back up. I have been using boAt for a very long time and it's my first boAt product as a Nuisance for me. Idk but may be I don't want to use these boAt products anymore. I never return anything to the sellers because i always get the best everytime. But these boAt Airdopes 441 are simply a huckfead for me. However, sound quality is good no doubt in that, as always. Good for music and movie kind of stuff. But no gaming and no calling performance. Thank you. (My POV)"
"The build quality and battery life was a pleasant surprise for TWS earphones in this budget. Sound quality is as good as, if not better than Apple Airpods. Bass is the highlight of this pair of buds, it felt a bit too bass-ey during the first use but the sound quality is so well balanced you can never go back to using other earphones.Extremely happy with the purchase!!"
Writing this review after using it for 15 days.Battery backup is as promised. It has been more than 14 days and I still haven't charged the case. Earbuds backup is also good and they get charged very soon once you put them in case.Instant wake-up and pair after opening the case feature is add-on and saves lots of time.Would recommend to buy this.
"First i got was actually used, which was promptly replaced.Second piece I got was fresh but the battery of the earpiece would not holdup for more than 30 minutes at max. After 30 minutes it goes off. and keep changing every 30 minutes, as per manual each earbud should last atleast 3 hours.Audio quality is ok good for taking office calls and confortable."
"Order these yesterday i.e. 20th Jan 2021 and got delivery today i.e. 21st Jan 2021. These are my first TWE so I am not sure what arr the things I should look for, but since I have been using Sennheiser wired in-ear earphones I can say that these are not upto that level but will surely scratch that listening itch for anyone. However, I am sure these will take some ""getting used to""  time as my ears are a bit painful after 10-15mins of play time.Will update this review if necessary, but I can say these are just awesome and totally worth the money."
This is a real scamFirst of allI got a defective piece with rattling background noise in both the earbuds.Then I replaced it but this time the right bud was dead on arrival and the left had the same rattling issue.The packaging also was different on both the units which is quite strange and suspicious.
"Excellent noise cancellation, fast connection speed and impressive bass. It will never fall off in the gym because of it's design. It has been around 3 weeks since I'm using it and I can say this product is worth buying but there are a few cons :1) In the first 2 days it might feel irritating to your ears2)battery life is average"
I like the battery case and the way it connects as soon as you open it. Since these are ear in’s so the noises outside are controlled. You can listen to music or take calls. It connects well with apple and windows and all mobile devices. Pairs fast and does not give any lags.
"Product is average… key downsides are1. no noise cancellation at all…when speaking with fan running in the room, the audio gets choppy2. Often sync misses between two pods…need to keep the pods in the case again and use.3. Touch points are very sensitive, often gets pressed when using in sleeping state..4. Easily pop out and may get lost in journeys5. The charging port design is very old with a cover over it.. may break easilyPros are,1. Good battery backup2. Good sound quality3. Extra covers provided in the package4. C type charging port and cable given"
"Best at this price point. Received today. now let's see how it will perform after long time use. Over all appearance is awesome. Lights,Bluetooth connectivity, battery backup , phone charge option, sound quality, touch sensitivity everything is working properly without any issues. Phone call clarity is also good. You can go for it. Because it is giving 150 hours of battery backup which is huge. Also in emergency you can charge your phone from it. Charging speed is also good. So it is quickly charge case as well as buds. Bought this at 2499rs price ,441 pro. I'll update over all performance after long usage. But call quality is very poor zero noise cancellation.. you will face problems while calling at public area or in traffic. . Awesome experience for music."
"Product rating : 4/5In the Box: 1xpair of Ear-Buds, 1xcharging case, 1xcharging cable, User manual.Overall product is good for usage and worth for money Rs.2499 comparatively to other brands in the Market.PERFORMANCE:1.Instant wake N pair - working as expexted. Once you open the charging case your ear-buds will connect automatically to your recent paired device.2.Battery - It can continuously used for 3 hours from 100% charge.3.LED indicators - It will indicate for pairing mode and paired as well4.one touch&Voice assistant - Touch is more sensitive and it has full control to your music other than adjusting volume, coming to Google voice assistant working fine for making call from your contacts and adjusting volume using voice command.Sound clarity : sound clarity is good for both music and calls.QUALITY:charging box- GoodEar-Buds - GoodType-C cable- Very goodRELIABILITY:1 Year manufacturer warranty."
"It is very nice product, sound quality is outstanding.Very easy to handle. Touch button are very well settled.C-Type cable (charging wire) is very short....company should increase length.One Most Important request : We are in Make In India movement....Please manufacture product in India. If you will charge Rs.400/- extra for make in Make In India product........I will be more happy to pay you. BUT QUALITY SHOULD BE COMPROMISED"
"I got it delivered on 8th August.This is my first purchase of TWS so I was pretty excited for the product and the product is actually very nice.The voice is clear and no problem in voice output.Also it gives you a pleasant experience in listening music.I was worried whether I would be able to make call through it or not comfortably as I have seend reviews for many TWS where call quality is not good.But for this TWS i am too satisfied with the calling quality.I have tried calling indoors as well as crowded place for more than an hour immediately after getting it and there was no problem in calling even in crowded place.The person on other side is able to listen me clearly and i can listen his voice clearly.So you can definitely go for it if you want to get TWS for calling purpose.It fits perfectly in ear and i shakes my heads many times to check if it gets out,but well it was stuck in ear perfectly.The battery life of earbuds is great. It works for approx 5 hrs as claimed by boat.And the charging case having feature of power bank function is great. You can charge your other devices in case of emergency.Audio video sync is nice while playing a video.I have even tried playing pubg, and there was not much of latency.So we can play pubg with this airdopes.I purchased it for 2499 and it's definitely a great purchase at this price considering all the features."
Bass is awesome....trebles are good.... High nd lows are clear... I m using this for almost 7 months now...no major issues i faced till now...sometimes u can hear a buzzing noise in left ear bud but that will go as soon as u play something.....Over all a really good wireless TWS by boat...appreciated 🤗❣️
Sound quality 311 betterAsthetics 411 betterFeel and quality 311 betterBluetooth range is very poorCall and sound quality is poorMicrophone reception is poorWhat can you use this for?Jogging... as even it falls and breaks you don't lose a lot.For audiophiles.... please don't buy. You will never use it
"Boat airdopes has battery problem, in my case one side airdopes battery wiped in a 1 hour.Product has battery charging problem with airdopes not with battery box, at the same time one side airdopes not working sometime due to technical battery fault, and if the product not working then how I can tell you that this is good in sound or bass..remember they are very limited option about warranty..buy good brand airdopes.. and avoid these Chinese products"
"Initial 2months product worked good. Then connection issues started. After 3 months one earpod volume gone down. Now connection is messy, can't talk on calls, lots of noise. Now can't receive calls. Can use one earpod, just to listen to media. 6 months product lifespan. 3k not worth."
"I bought this for my wife. Overall build and sound quality are good. Connection stays stable. Mic works properly if you are in a quite room. Outside, other party finds it hard to hear.Overall satisfied with the quality considering its Rs2500"
right side sound stopped working after 10 days only. Then replaced with new one. New pair worked well for 2 days only. after that both headphones were disconnecting after every 10 seconds and connecting again.Battery backup is good.Thanks amazon for great return policy.
This review after 3 months.1.  When I recived the Boat 441 in first time feels Good in Bass and sound clarity.But battery backup of carry case is only sufficient for 2 times full charge of ear buds.In the same time buds battery backup is good enough for 3.5 hrs. So I plan to change the carry case.But boat service center says not possible to change carry case only.We are sending charging case along with buds.I said ok.2.Wthin 1.5 weeks I received  another set. But this time Ear buds sound quality and bass was very poor compared to previous one.Also backup of buds only for 2 hours maximum. But carry case is sufficient for 4 full charging near to company said. So I again disappointed and plan to return for another pair.So again I went to boat service  center. This time they have stock in ready for giving me on the spot .I replaced old one.3.Now this time situation is good sound quality and bass as I received first time. But battery backup of buds is only 2 hours like second time. And carry case backup is sufficient for nearly 3.5 times charging of buds.I am totally disappointed😭.what I do next.Please consider seriously this situation. This is intimation to company marketing authorities to. Solve this issue.Because company says 5 hours backup for buds for moderate sound.And 4 full charging for buds (Excluding first charging ).
"Bass is very boomy. I shouldnt complain becuase I wantd it to be a bit bassy. Problem is - there is no way to tone it down as and when needed. On dialogue heavy things like podcasts or movie scenes the heavy bass is kind of drowning voice. You can hear the sound but wont understand a thing.Wired earphones work with device equalizer on both pc and mobile. But BT earphones usually wont do that.Got it for 1999 and overall its ok product. After a long session has to go to low volume to recover from the bass fatigue thats all.Fits ok, not falling off, has enough volume too."
"The overall product feels so premium and definitely will satisfy the cost incurred, the left earphone has a light buzz wen not in use for me but other than that the product will definitely be your moneys worth... The bass is stupendous, being a total basshead I love it, the packing is done beautifully promoting the premium effect and the airdopes are very lightweight so one can use it for hours without getting nauseous and without the need for charging the case so frequently... I'm so surprised that so many features can come in such a low price for such a quality product... HATS OFF BOAT!! This is my first boat product and I think they just gained my brand loyalty..."
Writing review after 7 months. All off a sudden the left earbud stopped working and did reset many times but of no use so if u buy it rem it’s Chinese and will behave like Chinese... never know when it stops and no help from boat customer service and u will have agin spend money to buy a new ones very quickly. So thnk b4 u invest
"Really liked it. For general music listening it's very good, bass is nice. For using it while doing some swift movements gyming Or running ensure the pod is fixed well in the ear the extra fin like things really helped the pod stay for some time in my ear. Pairing is smooth to the phone. So i did notice a difference when calling over whatsApp vs regular call provider. I found internet calls were crystal clear. The range is surely 10 mtrs from the phone. Using only a single pod works really well. Battery back up is yet to accertained."
"This video my first tws, and am very much satisfied with the sound clarity. Find it better than my wired xiaomi earphones. The charging case makes use more convenient, and makes it possible to use multiple times without the hassle of repeated charging. Reasonably priced at 2499/- in a sale. No connectivity issues, most of the times."
"Sent a defective product right earpiece stopped working after 15 days only, after initiating a return with BOAT customer care they sent an ugly looking yellow earpiece on top of that it also stopped working in just 4 days. They will just frustrate you ask you to drop an  email which takes 4 days to respond and another 20-25 days for your product to be replaced. Never go for such cheap product and fraud companies."
"It's an average product.Fit and ergonomics- not a solid fit. Kinda 3/5. But the main problem is with the soft touch button. Since the fit is not good, every time you adjust your earphone. When you do that, the soft touch just pauses music. You keep tapping it to revive the music. A big let down. So 2/5 on that count.Sound quality: again very middling. But considering the price point, kinda ok. Probably 3.5 out of 5  for sound quality.Usage with phone call: don't use it. The person other end can't hear you, unless you shout. That's only indoors. For outdoors, forget it"
The first supply did not work and was replaced. In India we have no aim for FTR - First Time Right attitude. We feel we have satisfied the customer by replacement but we are forgetting that the brand erosion has already has happened. There is no cancellation for this item cleverly planned. Amazon must have uniform policy when the reliability and quality of Indian & Chinese products are pathetic.
EAR THEATRE  DONT THINK MUST BUY  BATTERY BACK UP IS SUPERB IT IS BLUETOOTH AIRDOPES BOAT AGAIN PROVED HIMSELF VERY GOOD SOUND QUALITY USE FILM MODE WHEN YOU HAVE ONE PLUS MOBILE THEN YOY WILL GET AMAZING SOUND DONT LISTEB TO ANY ONE GO FOR IT WOWWW AIRDOPES AFTER A LOT OF PURCHASE  FINALLY I GOT WHAT I WANT
"Quality is nice, as it is made in china, anyways government support companies like boat to import electronic goods to India but the small seller who wish to import such goods and wanted to sell they don't support at all.So my wish is to support all small sellers and businesses who also import and sell such things on amazon not only BAot."
"SUPER SUPER SUPER, THE BEST PRODUCT, IF YOU WANT TO BUY A AIRPOD THEN GO FOR THIS WITHOUT ANY THINKING.BEST PRODUCT EVER...I M USING THIS FROM LAST 5TO6 DAYS, i can't charge this till now and running still.VERY BEST BATTERY BACKUP, BEST BASS...BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE INCREASE VOLUME WITH THIS EARPOD."
"It is good product, you can buy it.- i really liked the sound quality in music, movies and videos- battery backup is good, it can used 4 to 5 hours continue and charge in only half an hour- in design and comfort I'll give 3/5, it is okay but not much comfortable in my case- and the battery charger or case's battery backup is also good, i only need to charge it once in a week, it can last long if your usage is low- the cons i found out that the right side earbud's battery drains first and the left after 5 to 10 mins, I don't know if it is a good or bad, i tried to charge both equally but this happens everyday- 2nd con is the noise cancellation not good at all, on the call the opposite person tells me everytime that he cannot hear my voice properly and the background noise is too loud, you need to find peaceful place for calls then it's good.so it is not suitable for calls but music, movies and videos it is nice."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 There is no complaints regarding the audio quality... Its pretty much what you expect from a ₹2000 earbuds. But the charging box's lid's hinge is a little flimsy, I guess that could be improved.Overall very nice earbuds, different sizes of ear-cushions and shark fin hooks are included.Not that bass heavy but reasonably loud and punchy.Another pretty decent product from boat."
Superb Bass. Mids and Highs are also not bad. I think in this segment you can't expect anything better than this. Backup and connectivity is also good. Good fit and lightweight. Totally satisfied. Also got it at a deal price of 1999. Go for it.
Used it for 1 year and experience is not good. Cons:There is a issue in the earbuds. The earbuds dont pair with each other sometimes so have to restart the earbud or put it back into the case and remove it. Its quite irritating.Mic is not good.After using fr 1 year sound breaks in the middle and so cant listen to songs n allPros:Sound quality is too good as in all Boat earphonesGood Basscomfortable and it fits in ear properly.Charging time is good.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This is a decent headphone. Sound quality is fine, bass is satisfactory,noice cancellation is moderate but has an immense problem when it comes to speaking it has tremendous surrounding noice. Your voice can't be heard from the opposite side. It's dull when it's speaking with noice.I hope boat can take some step."
"The sound quality is better than I expected as I used a headphone before it's bass quality was really nice so I was confused between tws or headphones but I did took the risk and it's really beyond my expectations if u are looking forward to purchase this product I would suggest u not to hesitate as this is worth the price overall the case is not much premium looking the bass quality is fantastic it's look are not bad not so good I prefer sound quality more than look if u can get 3 hours of listening time on the buds and u can easily depend on the case to charge 4-5 times 100% overall it's a good product and worth the price I'll suggest u to go with thisUpdate after 5 months : other side stopped working suddenly,,the case and buds plastic quality is cheap"
"Overall ok product. Sound quality is good, bass works. Battery back is very less upto 3 to 4 hrs, if use for calling purpose. It might be  give more back in case of listening music.PowerCharging slot is not up to the mark,evry time you have to ensure 2 to 3 times that it is charging or not. Overall this product is usefull for music not for calling."
Very Good Product in this price range 2.5kusing since last 1 week but no problem at allworking very fine.battery back is quite good.I purchased it especially for calling purpose as i got so many calls & i’m tired holding mobile. it really meets my expectations as i can freely moves while calling without holding mobile.Nice Lighting.Sound quality is very nice for both Calling & Music.Definitely go for it..🥳🤩

 Writing this review after 1 month of intense usage from gaming to YouTube to almost all OTT platforms..it performs like gem..this is the best purchase I have ever did on Amazon..Super sound quality under any circumstances it cancels all from outside and open the new world for you. But you need a good phone too, not chi**se junk phones.Super connectivity best battery life almost 5 days after single charge, and charges in 1 hour from 25 w charger.Simply go for it blindly no 2nd thoughts."
"Purchased back in November 2020. Worked good for the initial 2 months then battery backup went down to 45 mins.Definitely not worth the price as it should at the very least function without any issues for 2 years.Better to make a one time purchase of high end earpods from the likes of Sony, Apple, Samsung, etc."
"Guys, this is a good product with a good quality of sound. Bass is good not bad, voice quality is not up to the mark or I can say you shouldn't expect a good voice call quality with ear buds coz the air flow will surely be a disturbance when talking.I won't compare the pros and cons but if you are not concerned about the battery life like the non-pro does not have 150 hrs so you can buy those and save a little.If you are a person who likes trekking or long drives literally long ones ;-) then go for the pro version.Once again don't expect a good quality with the voice calls when there is air flow over the mic.If you want for the sole purpose of driving and talking this is not for you, go for the ones that have a shoulder band, those mic quality are much better compared to this one."
"Its a really good pair of Airdopes. Good bassJust at the low volume its a bit too soft need to keep the volume on 65 percent onwards to get a really good feel. Distance from the phone pretty much 10 or 15 meter later it get a bit faded. Looks too good permium quality the led lights on the CTC ( capacitive touch control ) . The fit is too good if any problems you feel its a bit loose change the ear tips. It fits really well in helmets but an advice do not use both together while riding a bike you literally can't hear much . The CTC button is too sensitive but need to get used to it.The colour variant is too catchy really nice. I was expecting a big charging case but when I saw it was so small like literally fits ino your palm.Iys has magenetic charging so your airdope dont fall off and the lid is magnetic so it wont open unecssarily. Its has a C type charging port thats one great thing done by boAt since most of the phones have C type charging port you wont have to search for a charger. I just got it today still need to play around with it will update in a while . Overall great product ,only the volume at the low which does'nt sound great needs a bit fix but thumbs up great product must buy.And great delivery and packaging by Amazon"
"Whatever so people give negative review about this product base on sound quality,it's all bogus...At the range of 2k-3k ,this product is good...Dint fall while jogging (unless u have distorted ear structure)And for backup,all batteries in universes drain out and need to charge on time..."
"I have been a customer of Boat headsets for over 5 years now, I was a bit hesitant to buy a TWS, even though I trust Boat products, I wasn't sure to buy it. But when I did, it passed all my expectations.Pros:-1. You are a bass lover? Buy it. Bass is so damn good for this headset.2. Battery is very good, I thought the battery would drain like anything, but No, battery is too good.3. Sound quality is too good4. Calling is decentCons:-1. The stripes may pain your ears, it depends on your ear size, if your ears are big enough, then the earbuds are very comfortable, for me my ears are a bit small, So until I place the buds in certain way, I am experiencing a slight pain after using the earbuds for like 1 hour.2. The touch, the touch is a bit complicated in this earbuds, I dont know whether this is the case for all tws, but for this, when your skin touches the charging pins on the ear buds, only then the touch works, So for the touch to work on the ear buds, you've got to place ear buds in a certain way, that touches the charging pins to ear's skin.For me touch is not at all a problem, So, I dont have any issues with that, but if thats important to you, you might wanna think about purchasing this product. But, sound is what matters to you and you have a certain budget, just go for it.This is your BUY.!!!"
Awesome !!!!! eardopes !!!!. Everything is so good and also have powerbank feature which is amazing and good for those who need to purchase powerbank . It is light weight and easily carry anywhere  and the power backup is amazing it was charged half of my vivo V9 cell phone battery  with in 40 minutes  the Charging is very fast no doubt.  value of money 💰 👌👍
"Writing this review after 4 months of using the product. The earbuds are a waste of money, do not buy them! The sound quality and battery life is good. But that is all. Has a lot of connectivity issues. Connectivity while playing media is good but during calls it disconnects every 30 secs. It is impossible to speak on calls usng these earbuds! The only good thing that has come out of buying these earphones is I can use them for music while working out and they don't fall off. My friend bought the older version of airdopes for 1500 bucks and that is much better quality and does not have such connectivity issues. Go for that instead."
"Previously I thought I will get used to them... But the thing is these ear-buds are not at all good.As a music lover I have used products from many different companies... I also own BOAT headphones which are good. That's the reason I preferred Boat over Chinese TWS ear-buds. But I was wrong.Call Quality - 1/5Connection - 1.5/5 you have to connect manually or more than once because of sound glitch 8 out of 10 times.Sound quality - 3/5 Overloaded with bass. Misses too much of highs and mids.Verdict- I have used a lot of headphones and earphones... And believe me. I am regretting buying these. If you want to waste your money you can go for it otherwise buy OnePlus or spend more on better products.Edit: after 6 months of buying, left side tws stopped working. They provided me a refurbished unit as replacement, and after 6 more months the left side stopped working again. Now these are out of warranty, and I have to buy new tws. Paid 2,500 for 11 months... Thank you for your tws product quality Boat!"
"if you just care about listening to music its perfect for you it has a good overall bass quality in the price range, it doesn't tell you on what RF its working but it has a range of 18.6m without obstruct i can feel the latency if you move the reciever or the source (your head or your phone) repeatedly but its too little that it can be ignored for general use afterall it works on RF so latency is just physics can't do much about it in any wireless system transreciever bandwith is good you can really appreciate the diversity of each soundwave in a song obviously if the song has got it, i also used it for my morning run no effect of normal sweating so far i will surely not do a water resistant test on will but so far good.. case battery is 500 mAh and 35mAh per earbud if you use 1 at a time you can get along a day or more on a full charge(case+buds) with normal usage, non-stop playback time is 4.2hrs for each earbud which i would say again is good but not great you can use 1 bud at a time to maximine the total play time, case recharge both of your buds nearly 4 times on a full charge, its good for non network gaming with negligible a latency but network/internet/online gaming is NOT RECOMMENDED not just on this but on any wireless set.. it will give you out of the world latency. thats my 2 month use review on this product, hope it helped."
"Awesome earpods from boAt. Sound Quality is excellent as the other boAt products provide. Noise Cancellation and Bass quality is also very good. The touch functions which are provided like receiving and rejecting calls, changing and pausing songs those are also very useful. I will not recommend it for gaming purpose, because there is a slight latency while playing games. Only a small drawback I found that is the touch surface is very sensitive, for that even when you try to adjust the earpods in your ears, that time also it takes the touch and performs the functionality. Apart from that the product is very good."
It's good for Playing music and even calls but Noose cancellation is not as expected.It's good for personal use and not for official purposes. Sounds robotic for Skype and Teams call. Very disappointed.
The sound quality is superb. Bass quality is good. Sporty look. Only issue is with Connectivity. Often losses connectivity while on call or even on music mode. Touch is highly sensitive. Issue with battery back up. As shown here is 4 hours at one charge but I feel it is not more than 1.5 hour at once with continuous music mode I have tested personally. However case has only back up of 500mah only. Don't know how much time it take for charging with case. Continuous use not possible however better choice 441 pro has more battery back up. Buds have limited touch control. Multitasking or multifunction is not supported this is big issue. Further siri or Alexa or Google speak works only when the phone is unlocked. Often faces problems where one buds battery gone and others have it is big confusion. Notice cancellation not working properly. Faces issue with noise cancellation. Also faces problems while working over call wid buds about eco sound and other disturbances sound due to use of buds. Overall it's a okay product not worth at this price where better options are available in mkt.
Very tight on ear . So difficulty in staying it there . Very high sensitivity of touch commands.So unexpected call cutting is an issue. My right ear bud not works some time so no chance  to return the product after 10 days.High battery backup is a plus point for case and earpods .I recommend to buy semi wired blutooth  headphones  because it can be  used in bike driving. This can't use as we wear helmet . Touching  side of helmet will lead to call discunnection.
"Sound quality - Bass : Good, Volume as in loudness : Average.Noise Cancelation (While listening)- Could be betterNoise Cancelation (Call) - Average.Quality ( Airdopes) - Plastic quality : good, Rubber feel : Good.Quality (Case) - Average.Battery - The airdopes when used together lasts about 6 hours and the case can full charge the airdopes about 5 times.Comfort level - Feels discomforting after wearing the airdopes for about 2 hours.Listening experience - Keeping at a volume of 80% music is clear but still some loud outside disturbances can be heard.The case is sturdy but after a week's usage the lid even after closed some clicks while tapping  can be felt, meaning the case is closed uneven at some parts...Apart from these small imperfections the product is fantastic and I highly recommend at a price range of 2000 - 2500."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 One side of the airdope wasn't working at all.. it only had one red light and none other lights were being displayed.. the right side was completely fine.. whereas the left was damaged.. I'm awfully disappointed.. the sound quality was nice as do was the noise cancellation.. it did not have a replacement option(despite having mentioned it has a 7 day return/replacement) so I had to return and reorder the same item.."
"I'm writing this review after 1 week use of the product. I'm specifying the points about which everyone is concerned, before buying an earpod:1. Terrific sound quality with ear-satisfying bass.2. 0% (zero percent) audio-delay/lag while playing pubg or any other game.3. Call quality is terrific, the person on the other side can listen to your voice clearly and you don't have to shout. The product is having a passive noise cancellation technology due to which the microphone cancels the noise while taking the audio input.4. Airdops touch control is seamless, be it accepting/rejecting calls or controlling music/video.5. Battery life is good, it runs more hours than it is specified. But if you are in call aor play games for a longer time then it would last for the number of hours it is mentioned in the specification of this product.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is seamless, it gets connected automatically whenever the box is opened. (Provided that it is connected manually for the first time only)7. Light weight and you would have no pain in your ears even if you wear it for 5 to 6 hours at a stretch."
"Ticks all boxes..best feature is the eargrip. Good enough for cycling but may not last a heavy workout or running. Pairs easy. Sounds good. Responsive intutive controls. Good range. Holds charge well. Neat and easy to use charging case, just clicks in.Couldn't ask for more. Just hope it lasts."
"Airdopes are good for attending lecture, watching videos, listening song but attending calls can be difficult  due to no noise cancelation.For calling you hav second option to hold you another buds near your mouth so that the other person can hear you clearly and that's  the only to fix that. I am not a person who do much of calling.The only thing I found best is the battery  backup ever you can buy powerbank for the rush of hour but powerbank inside is better which dont let you carry another bank. It can charge your phone to more than 50 %. And it will work for more than 10 days in light usage.Haven't  practically  tested will edit soonComfort is very good in this price range. You will get feeling of galaxy buds not one with the kidney shape. But for long term like more than 2-3 hour it might pain a little based on your ear size.Latency is freaking high. You can not play online games or any games with it. More than 300ms.Buid quality I think is premium because I  have checked out apple buds or any other premium buds yet. But it will last more than 1 year I think. Better register your product in advance for precautions."
"While I like the sound quality, I find that the battery charge does not stay long. I had purchased Boat Airdopes 280 earlier. It still lasts for 2-3 days after a full charge, whereas the Airdopes 441 is not even lasting one full day.Another UX issue In find us that the pod case is too soft and slippery to hold. Minor issue but can be very irritating at times.Overall, Not worth the money."
"Good sound quality and very compact case. Battery life is good and lasts at least 5 hours on medium volume. Liked the red color, it's very attractive. Also the LED status lights on the earpods are cool. Capacitive touch is very sensitive. Instant power on and pairing when open the case is a good and innovative feature."
"This is a nice product.I was cynical at first because their earphones went bad in a month.The sound is good, the Bluetooth range is okay.Battery backup is small but it charges pretty fast.It has been a good 10-11 months and the quality remains the same.I feel a bit weird about this design (for all brands) because you have to hold the bud in hand to talk to other people or for the momentary need to hear carefully while handling other things. Aren't the Bluetooth headphones that you can hang around your neck better?"
"I tried to contact amazon to return but they are not picking up the item, its been 15days and customer support is not helping on this as well, be sure before buying this product, once u buy u cant return fo sure. Amazon has made a very worst image in my my mind after this incident. Thanks for the realisation."
"Best product worth the money.I bought it for Rs.1949.... And not to say i was curious of the product.Its small, nearly weightless and good sound quality as well as the built is very good. I like it a lot.Magnetic holders is a good touch... No need to worry about loosing it from the charging box. I never had an issue pairing with my mobile device.I read lot of comments telling its bad and not good and waste of money... Maybe its the problem with the unit what they received.Till now no issues for me and go ahead and buy before the offer goes away.Overall a 4.3/ 5.0 rating from my side."
Charge does not stand even for 2 hours properly and also charging time is a total drag. Totally disappointed. If your a IT person expecting earpod that stand with a long battery life I will not suggest this . Better spend some more money and go for OnePlus earpod (IT work from home PEOPLE)
"Im using them since Oct 2020... Almost 7 months.... Using them during Gym for daily 1 hour.. and I still haven't charged them since 7 months and still it's showing 50% remaining... It promises 150Hours of play back ... I will update the date till it completely drains out... And the noise cancellation is amazing...once u wear them u wont even hear a single thing from outside and thanks to the dual driver ..the audio quality is amazing.. Bass,Lows mids and highs are amazing... Its worth buying and best under 3k... Battery backup is amazing"
"I bought this TWS on 14 Aug 21. After using it for about 40 days ..suddenly left earbud has stopped working. I am amazed how. After numerous attempts if resetting the device and watching videos/troubleshooter, still the problem persist. Even the invoice being downloaded is not opening. Request AMAZON to please kindly look into the issue and resolve the problem.Its not important to sell tonnes of product during festive sale, what's vital is after sale assistance must be provided.Hope that you will respond to this review & correspondance."
"Wrote this one after a month of usage, am a IT guy who working more 10hr a day. Frequently attending calls and meeting. Apart from myself ,This product suit’s well for Indore as well some outdoor activities (while walking and jogging)Battery back up is ok for me. It stand up 3Hr in a single charge.Distance wise it cover up 8 to 10 feet clearly.While using feel some pain in back of ears.I know that’s normal cause of long usage other wise this product is value of what I pay."
"I've purchased many ear buds over the years but these ones have really inspired me to write a review. The battery life with case have totally eliminated the dependency on wired earphones. The bass in these is literally ear rattling and I mean it in a good way. Also it's quite some hassel when you use touch control on wireless ear buds if they are not sensitive enough and require you to press them a little hard for the touch to be recognised, and it becomes painful if you use touch very often.But the touch sensitivity in these is next to perfection. The gentlest of touch is enough for it to recognise and that has made all the difference."
"While the ear buds in themselves are not bad, for me, the major issue was, that  it keeps falling out of the ear ! So unless one is sitting or lying prone, using these buds are a problem. Sadly, amazon or the seller says they will replace it with the SAME model- which is pointless - unless the piece is faulty."
"If right gets connected, left doesn't and if left does than right doesn't.One of the worst product, I am requesting a refund.Please dont buy, waste of time and moeyUpdate:::Now after 5 months left side stop working completelyPathetic product..No support from boat, please dont buy it"

Left ear bud is not working....its just 1 year we have bought this product. Really disappointed
Best earbuds you can have on amazonI love the qualityThe battery life is so powerfulFirst i feel that its not comfortable but when i started using it sometimes i forgot even they are in my ears so comfortableI have not charged yet i just put the buds in the box and the keep charging by there selfs and box need to be charged once in 15 days 😇
"One side earbud had buzzing noise and became very quiet after only a few months. Got a replacement unit and even that too started having the same issues and the left earbuds dies after just 15 minutes of use (without any battery low warning), while the other works for a few hours. Also the volume levels are vastly different for different apps and types of content, unlike other headphones. Music apps are extremely loud, whereas video content is very quiet at the same volume level. Also the connection is lost randomly when you pause the content, but it will still show that it’s connected, so have to disconnect and connect again. This issue happens very frequently."
Really nice! Love them.. I use them every day for full day office calls.. I don't need to hold the phone in hand till my arm hurts any more or struggle with wires around me!Very nice.. quality sound.. Good bass.. I love listening to music while running.. They don't fall off!The only problem I found..u can't keep them in ear full day..but that all depends from person to person! What I do is I keep 1 on and then change to other side when tired.
"The Boat Airdope 441 is totally worth every penny. This advanced wireless earphones are classy and come with fully capacitive touch controls. The box comes with 3 pairs of extra ear buds, one charging cable and an user manual. The sound quality is pretty great. The ear pieces fit in snugly into the ears and stay right in place despite a lot of head movement. The microphone is very good and one can easily answer phone calls with the earphones as the sound is clear and crisp. Although personally I did not like the constantly blinking indicators on the earpods, it's hardly a blip in the design. It is overall a great investment."
"It has been an year now that I bought this product.. It was amazing at the beginning and as time progressed, it started to disconnect on its own. Either of the buds go mute while listening to music all of a sudden and connect back after sometime and repeats continuously... And mic is worst... From the beginning it was poor, but now it doesn't work at all.. tried resetting it 100s of times but no use. .... Really disappointed"
"I had purchased these airdopes for complete wireless handsfree experience for my handset. But they are good only for music not for live calls. They have lot of sync issues when using for voice calls or online meetings. So if anyone planning to buy only music experience go for it, but if calls too, better research for alternative."
Wow  🤩  find one thing and do that one thing better than anything else that’s boat 🥰🥰🥰love the earbuds🥰🥰 it’s verymuch suit for iPhone 8🥰🥰🥰same as describedQuality is highLove the color and matte black caseBattery super
Pros1: The bass is really really good.2: battery backup is around 3 hrs after full charge.3: you get a power bank4: The fins give the buds a very tight grip so they don't fall even if you are doing intense workouts .5: perfect for joggers or runners6: good connectivityCon :1: the bass overpowers the treble2: the case is heavy and bulge out in the pockets3: not for long usage as after an hour or so your ears might hurt because of the fins4: voice calling quality is average5: noice cancellation is ok.
"Excellent product. Connects readily to phone via bluetooth. Excellent sound quality and sound cancellation. Good sound recording. Battery back up was 4.5 -5 hrs initially but after two month of use it is 2.5-3 hrs. At this rate, it may not last long. I shall write review again after a month."
"Good buy for the price. Sound quality is incomparable. The touch is really good. Automatically connects to phone when opened from the case.  Minor drawback is that you cannot hear any sort of noise happening around you when it's on the ear (even while song is not playing) but that's how the design is. And another slight drawback would be, on ears for too long, the rubber support starts to hurt a little bit."
"I had issues with left side of airdopes, so raised replacement request on the third day of purchase, the executive came to take the product but since then no mails no update about the product even after calling the customer care (they don't even bother to pick your call) then after a month I got my product but it was red! I purchased yellow and I got replacement of red colour, boat product has only life of 1 year and their left or right side of the audio product ends up detected I am reviewing this after buying every model of boat.Boat bass heads earphones all models bought everyone of them left side defectBoat stone speakerBoat bluetooth 225 - bought 2 of they ended up detectedNow bought boat airdopes411 pro after their big bollywood actors advertisement - that is also defectAnd boat's customer service is like we owe them millions money. Their attitude is the worst."
"Good product. Everything is good except for volume control u have to manage it with phone only . Overall it is best earphones in this range. I got it in 2250 only.Edit - after 2 months of usage I'm writing review again :-1.after using it for 1 to 1.5 hrs left ears pains due to fitting issue ( i don't know its manufacturing problem or causing pain in my ear only)2. Battery is superb . You can trust the battery blindly. Once charged the case fully it can be used for whole 3-4 weeks ( if u are average users)3. Sound is great. Enjoy the movie and music without any lag or discomfort.4. Only the main drawback for me is fitting problem in my left ear it causes pain in ear after use, i don't know why but left earbud gives a lot of pain in my ear and its a huge  drawback of product and because one can compromise on sound ,battery or looks but without proper fitting no one would go with it as it causes pain in ear.Edit 2 :- after 4.5 months of usage writing again :-it pain a lot in ear after using this earbuds sadly i have wasted my money , because if I'm not comfortable wearing then how can I use it. Changed my rating from 4 star to 1 star."
Pretty decent buds at this price point..Pros:-1) Great bass.2) Better noise cancellation than other companies at the same price.3) RGB lightning makes it look fabulous.4) 5 hrs battery life.Cons:-1) Noise cancellation could've been better.2) Ear pain after long usage.3) Its Made in China☹.
"This is totally messed up order from amazon.I have spent almost 3k on product and received seal broken product. When i open the package the boat airpod box have no official Seal on it, as i ordered multiple boat products this was first time that i received bad product.The airpods are used and having multiple scratches on it. airpod box was in broken condition and not having any packaging on it.First time bad experience with amazon and Boat.i have applied for Replacement product.Hope so i will get new and packed one."
"For me this boat airdopes 144 is perfect. Bass quality is too high for me in this ""boat 144"" so I had to adjust from my phone setting sound equalizer then I've to adjust from my google music player.Battery life is also very good😁.I'm using it while I'm doing carpentry & steel works cos of machine sound, now I'm happy that I've purchase this perfect boat airdopes😎."
"I've been using this for 3 weeks now. This product is for those who loves bass,no need to set bass booster mode on equalizer with this.  I used to listen to music by setting equalizer to bass boost mode but with this one u feel little bit discomfort bcz of over bass. Even normal mode gives very good bass from very low volume .i read a review that we need to turn volume to above 60 to get better sound but i din feel like that .i used to keep volume around 20 to 40% n it works well at all volume levels. Noise cancellation is not much effective but it's ok by me. Best fit in ears and u can do any kind of workout it won't jump out. Battery backup also very good for a normal user it is enough for 2 to 3 weeks. I din use for 5 hrs even though it will run 5 hrs i guess. It doesn't hv volume control i know that n i bought this bcz i could control volume with my samrt watch so there is no prob withthe absence volume control. I feel trouble when i get calls that my smartwatch disconnects frequently if i connected to airdopes. The wireless distance is max 10m without any interruption like walls. Overall it's okay and good product in this price range.its worth having go for it."
"It's good only when pairing with mobile. But when pairing with laptops, always there is some connectivity issue. And even if by luck paired with laptop, ALWAYS there is mic issue. And most most important, due to heavy magnetic usage in it, its painful to ears at times. 1000% Regret buying it :("
The airdopes are extremely poor in connection. Its been 20days and i started getting this problem of connection i would suggest not to waste your money on this product as they do not provide the facility to return the product . And talking about its structure than its heavy in weight and after an hour of use your ears will start paining coz its ear support is quite irritating.
"Sound is so good While using these I didn't notice any issues but while on call some sort of noise is observed....thats all.... previously i used boat earbuds311v2, I didn't observe a lot difference between these two...."
I buy eardope 441 blue in Oct 2020 nd its dead in Nov. after replced i got a different color black eardope and also used product old. Also defective piece. Too much disapoint. Poor service from Boat.  Also customer care cut my call without listening issue.
"Water resistant Fell in water by mistake. my son play wid that, thrown many times still nothing happened, used roughly...About product  Sound quality and noise cancellation nice,connects rapidly, I am using only for listening.. ******Not recommended if buying for communicate phone Calls."
"It's been 1 week using this boat Airdopes,1) The major problem with this product, while sleeping if you turn left or right due to the sensitive touch on the sides of airdopes it automatically changes to pause.2) sometimes automatically one of airpod stopped working and need to keep it again in to the box and start"
"Good product,notice cancellation and God sound effect...But the disappointing fact is these Airdopes doesn't stay 5 hrs charged if taken out of the case..If out of the box it works for 2 hrs again goes off need to put back into the case.. manufacturers need to look into this..they cannot false promise customers n charge so high for a not performing product..."
"I bought this just 4 days ago:Day 1 - Works perfectly, no problems at allDay 2 - Same as day 1Day 3 - Starts to disconnect form Bluetooth after 10 mins of use. I resets the airdope then try to connect but doesn't solve.Day 4 - Airdope is not connecting with my phone and now I ordered a replacement in hope to get better product this time.So conclusion is worst product ever."
This product is good in quality and material and price was also reasonable but only issue is with sound quality. If you will listen any song in full volume then you can feel bit pain in your eardrum because of sharp metallic kind of sound. Boat can improve it to get more good experience with us otherwise I didn't find any other lack.
"Short review: without any second thoughts just go for it. The best air dopes at this price segment. I GOT IT FOR RS.2400 DURING PRIME DAY SALE.(NEW LAUNCH).Full review:Pros:1.Main thing is it's battery backup and you can use it as a power bank too. With 2600mah battery powered case , it's the best.2.IPX7 water and sweat resistance makes it superb.3.Even with a 6mm driver, hearing music is a absolute bliss.gives you a awesome bass too.4.Comparing with 441 , this new 441 pro gives you extra battery backup, you can also use this air dopes for attending calls since the microphone is way better than 441.5.The Bluetooth version is 5.0 which is latest so no connectivity problems when the airdopes are near to the connecting device.Cons:1.The touch buttons are so sensitive, you should get used to it.2. The connectivity is poor when the distance between phone and airdopes becomes 6 meters.No other issues are found. JUST GO FOR IT , VALUE FOR MONEY, THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME 💖👌.NOTE: U WILL GET EXTRA EAR BUDS,TYPE C CABLE,MANUAL, WARRANTY CARD AND A CATALOGUE IN BOX."
The ear caps are too big and keeps falling from my ears. It is NOT returnable so people with small ears stay away. They will replace but who wants replacement if its fit is bad. Sound quality is also not the best and I struggled to pair it with PC. Not worth the price and you might as well invest in top brand.

 Airpode 441 Review1. Build quality good.2. Battery Backup good.3. Audio quality good.4. Calling quality (Mic)  Avg.Advice : Need to add volume control option in buds.Below 1999/- price it's been good product.(Manufacturer country name is not mentioned in the case box !!!!!!)"
"Rating 3 because of mic issue. I have replace this product once but with other pair of airdrops still facing issue. If you want to use this for as headphones then go for this but if you want to use for calls then waist of money. Mic quality is very poor. Capture background noice, voice level is very low. You have to shout then only other person can listen to you."
"I liked the sound quality.I strongly disliked the Bluetooth connectivity, It shows connected in mobiles, but you can't here audio, in 6/10 times. I checked multiple phones. It randomly goes mute. First i ordered the same device it didn't connect at all, and opted for a exchange and got a new piece. It worked well for few days then the problem started, being using it for past 6 months, got vexed with this device. Didn't expect this from upgraded version and from a brand like Boat.P.S - My air dopes 311V2  works good even after two years. Didn't expect the new one to be such a pain."
After going through reviews..I thought let's buy. But trust me.. it's not that great option. Sound quality is average but left earbud was not working..no sound so it's useless. Rather invest 1000 more and buy good one.Raised replacement but I am really not impressed with the product. There was no return option...which is bad. Let's see! 😖
"In the beginning it was really fine but later on it started showing its true color. Using this airpods is so painful. Most of the times i am holding one airpod in front of the mouth and other plugged in to my ear, even then sometimes my voice is not clear. Too many complaints from my friends and i realized this is the worst choice i ever had. Now after using it for 3.5 months i see strange things. I find it hard to connect to my phone. Sometimes even after getting connected it does not work, sometimes only one airpod works, as if its totally in the mood of the airpod if it wanna work or not. Now I am thinking to get it replaced or probably buy a new one. Bluetooth airpods in this range sucks."
This is the first time I have bought a product of boats and I totally unsatisfied and regret of doing that. When I have recieved my earbuds they were working fine but just after one day the right one stopped working. I have asked for the replacement and the this time the left one stopped working within a week. I went to to there service center and that was another level of painful experience. I have to wait almost four hours just get my number in waiting line. All the staff was super slow there. After that I recieved the third pair of earbuds in a replacement of the defected one but guess what this time the left earbud continuously make a wierd noise of 'weeeeeeeeeeep' and this sound gives pain to my ear after certain time of using it. After having this horrible experience I have lost all my energy and decided to let it go and promised myself to never use any boats product ever in my life. Worst experience ever!
Pros -1. Sounds good2. Price is pretty good rs2000 for 441 and rs2500 for 441 pro3. Colour choice is wide4. Connects instant to your phone on opening the case5. CTC is pretty resposive6. IPX7 rating7. USB - C charging8. Single earbud usage is possibleCons-1. Cannot go too loudAt thir price point they are pretty much worth the amount you spend. The sound quality isnt that awesome but its not that bad too. Go for it if you want a true wireless earbuds
"Great product as always from Boats! Slowly our entire home audio has shifted to Boat in last months. This TWS ear-buds is another fantastic recent addition. Brought them for my Mother, after my Wife was enjoying a previous TWS version for more than a year. No regrets, its only getting better with the Boat products :-)"
"Loving loving loving em!I put in a lot of thought process before finally deciding on these. No regrets!Best for the price you pay (Sale price is a steal)Good range, Good call quality, Sound quality is awesome.My set came with 100% battery which is a huge + point for me.Battery life is good...The case battery lasts for about 8 to 10 days when I uses the buds for around 3 to 4 hours a day. The earbuds themselve work very well for around 5 hours...But wearing these for longer period does hurt my outer ears a little"
"Used it for 12 weeks now (3 months) and all I can say is it's a very 'meh' product, extremely mid (average) sound quality, try using equalizer to get better sound quality, I use the Wavelet android app for that. Bass is somewhat acceptable but there is lot of distortion at higher volumes, tune it right and it sounds good. Microphone quality is fine but prone to noise so use it *only if you are indoors* seriously it is impossible for the person on the other end to hear you when you are in a noisy environment. Play/Pause delay is a little too high about 1 second should be somewhere half of that. Double tap to switch tracks took a lot practice to get used to to get it to work accurately even now I fail at it sometimes, this definitely needs improvements as it's somewhat annoying. No swipe volume control. Voice assistant I never use so can't comment.One of the better things is that each ear bud can work independently of the other, i.e you can connect either one of the ear buds without having to connect the other, this is a problem on some other brands like Jabra from what some people have told me. Pairing process was without much issue, but it's a little troubling that the ear buds are always in paring mode after taking it out of the case as someone can just randomly decide to connect to your ear buds if your own device does not connect to it quickly.Battery life of the ear buds is decent, about 4 to 6-ish hours depending on usage. Power-bank functionality is pretty useful helps in a pinch used it a few times. The cases battery is huge compared to the buds so I recharge it once in 2 weeks if I did not use the power bank feature.Comfort is subjective but for me initially I couldn't wear it for longer than 2 hours straight on the left ear and for 1 hour straight on the right ear, but after 2 weeks I got used to them can can wear them for 5+ hours. Sometimes laughing or running around while wearing them causes it to pop out, most likely a 'me' problem.More about the case, there is a cover for the ports so there's some protection for it but the covers flexible plastic hinge may break off if you are not careful when charging it. One thing to be careful about is to charge the case you need to have a USB Type-C cable with a thin casing else you can't insert it properly as the port cover gets in the way, my Amazon Basics Type-C cable does not fit for that very reason. The charging cable provided in the box is pretty flimsy looking and short so don't try to use it with other devices.The size of the case is huge compared to competitors so it looks awkward in some pockets this is mainly because the case is about 3 cms thick at the thickest part, if they could make it a little thinner it wouldn't be as noticeable. I wear jeans and T-shirts so the shirt somewhat hides the massive lump, it definitely won't fit in small pockets so not really suitable for office work environments as it looks awkward in pants even when standing, but this makes sense as a design choice as it seems to be marketed towards young adults (teens -> university students) since they usually use backpacks to carry around stuff.Haven't gotten it wet yet, so I can't comment on the claim of IPX7 splash resistance, I don't exercise while wearing them so can't comment on that either.As with any product treat it right and it will last you quite some time. Overall pretty satisfied with this 'meh' device solely because of the price point.Will update more on battery degradation later, but for now it seems right ear bud lasts a little longer than the left one about 15 mins longer. - 01/02/2022"
"This is first TWS after a good research on you tube and on official brand websites.I have been researching about getting a nice TWS earbuds for my everyday use.I wanted a product with great built quality, a decent battery backup and a good sound.The buds are very cool looking with a sleek and stylish recharging case of Active Black color. They are multifunctional buds with decent features packed. We get touch control system which is very active in response even on a slight touch we can see the effective response. The features very easy to use as just by tapping on the touch control, we can access all the controls of the music. And with the same ease we can check the check the charging left in the charging case just by pressing a button on the case.The pairing system is also very smooth. For the first time we just have to pair it with our phone, and then after that whenever we open the charging or carrying case and the bluetooth of the phone is on then automatically they will connect and disconnect after placing in the case and closing it.Pros1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.2. Type C Charging - I use a Samsung galaxy f41 so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. It doesn't feel bulky in the ears.5. Charging can also be used as a mini power bank for emergency (Recommended not to use it as a power bank very often).ConsNot much1. But sometimes automated functions don't work so we have to do them manually.Fix to the cons problemWe can factory reset the buds to remove those problems.And my experience of listening music in crowded place is very good. And the noise isolation they provide is also very good."
"Everything is Good- sound, bass, connectivity, touch sensitivity, noise cancellation, charging, battery, case etc. BUT one thing bothers me. When I put on the earbuds I can do anything, walk, run, eat, drive,jump etc. BUT when lay on bed sideways, the capacitive touch of the earbud touching the pillow gets touched and the earbuds get disconnected. so I put on only left side if I lay on  the right and vice-versa. If only this problem could be solved it would be great because not only me, but everybody loves to watch movies or listen songs or talks over phone while laying on bed.  Otherwise the earbuds are very very good."
Thw aound quality is totally amazing and we have really great experience while watching YouTube & movies. Listening to music is obviously top notch.Only issue is sometimes while talking on call the opp person cannot hear us and we need to speak a bit louder & this issue is not with each call but happens sometimes.
"I bought this product in March. The sound quality, bass was great. They were really comfortable. But after 5-6 months, suddenly the left side pod started discharging within 10-15 minutes.My brother also had bought this product one month earlier and he too started facing the problem within the same time frame. The worst part is my product is under warranty but there are not Enough service centers and those that you can find on Boat's official site, half of them don't pick up your phone or are dysfunctional.It's really disappointing to have this problem in such a reputed brand. And you can see other reviews, many seem to be facing the same issue after some time. Waste of money!"
It costs ₹2499/- while buying this Boat Airdope 441pro (active black).Sound quality is average. Ear started to feel pain after 3 hrs of usage. Noise cancellation is decent. Microphone doesn't work well if you are traveling or in a room under celling fan (full speed)I bought this product 31st October 2020. And it's now 10th October 2021.  I had to send this product to Boat's service center for two times within  this 9 months of usage. Both the times 10 days (×2) got wasted in this (receiving- servicing- delivering) process.The main issue was malfunctioning. After first 4 months of usage battery of left ear started to drain out to 0% within 2hrs meanwhile right ear still at 80% battery level.So I reported my issue at Boat suport online website. They mailed me back and accepted my request for servicing. It took 10 days and they replaced my product (because it was within my warrenty period)Again after around 3 months of usage same malfunctioning occurs and this time same battery drained faster in my right ear. While my left ear was at 80% battery level.Again reported my issue and they replaced the product and it took 10 days again.Now it's almost near the end of my warrenty period. I don't know if same thing happens again then I will have to live with that faulty product.THOSE WHO ARE PLANNING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT PLEASE THINK BEFORE BUYING IT.Better go with some other wired earphones that will provide better experience and costs less money.
I’m writing this review after a month of usage. The product is extremely good and it has fulfilled what it claims....only on the 1st day I full charged it and now its more than a month and there’s still half the battery is left in the pod!! I have been using it daily and must say...it’s totally worth every penny!!
"Writing this review after 38 days of complete usage. I wait for this day to write the review just to test the battery life of the charging case. I have used the dops for 6 to 7 hours an average per day (for office WebEx calls, phone calls and music). Airdops are lasting for ~5 to 6 hours based on the usage. The full charge of charging case last for 38 days - UNBELIEVABLECase Battery: 20/10Airdops battery: 10/10Auto connect: 10/10Sound clarity: 8/10Bass: 9/10Noise cancellation: 9/10Fit to the ears: 8/10Mic (mobile): 10/10Mic (Mac): 8/10Touch sensor: 7/10 (use palm for better results)Sensor delay: 6/10Audio delay (mobile): 9/10Audio delay (Mac): 5/10Airdops fit in the case: 7/10"
"Writing this after 15 days of use.Pros: Fit in the ears is nice. Not bulky that you will have to be constantly guarded that the airpods will fall off.Gets paired easily without much hassels.Battery backup - Used for little over 3 hrs at a stretch and didn't have to put the airpods in the charging box.Cons: Not ideal for calls. The calls get connected but there will be moments when the airpods skip / jump seamless connection. The other end of your caller will ask you to repeat as they missed hearing few words.After 2 to 2.5 hrs of use, your ears drums feel closed as the fit is so perfect deep into the ear canal. Your ears feel the need to breathe. Not all will like using it for more than an hour or so."
"I bought these yesterday & I've been using them ever since. Got it in a single day! Amazon really outdid itself.The airdopes are excellent. Especially with my phone, no complaints!However I tried using them with my laptop & realised that using bluetooth earbuds with hotspot is not feasible.I used them with my smart tv & they work incredibly well.I am very happy with my purchase & would recommend them to anyone who is keen on trying wireless earbuds."
"First off, let me tell you that my primary headphones are Skullcandy Crushers Wireless, so you can just imagine my expectations of ""bass"" and overall sound quality in earphones/headphones; quite honestly, it has spoiled me and ruined all other options as nothing really gets me going like them monsters ( i like my music bassy, without sever compromise on clarity ofcourse).I ordered this for casual use outdoors after a lot of research for bassy earbuds (my first boAt product), and this one popped up consistently in all reviews and suggestions. Having negligible hopes, I was all prepared to be underwhelmed...BUT boy oh boy, I was pleasantly surprised by these, almost a smile on my face in first couple of songs - quite a big  achievement in my books.The bass makes it's presence felt prominently, without severely overshadowing the vocals - so the mids are fairly good; although the highs are a little damp. That being said, the sounds output in general is reasonably clear considering the price point (bang for the buck honestly). If you want neutral sounding earbuds, look elsewhere as these are only going to please people who like their music ""flavored""Take a bow boAt.."
"I frankly had initial reservation while purchasing this product, so no hard feelings. But this proves why products that have a better QA team are always better, which also justifies their higher cost.I have been using this product for 8 months now.1. The sound quality is not good, bass looks artificial, sometime sounding like old cassette tape when it used to get stuck or play slowly.2. The shrillness in the voice is all over the place, no consistency there.3. There is a good lag in sound and voice delivery, the lag is clearly noticeable.4. Within 8 months the upper charging pin of right earbud has got recessed. So the charging is not consistent now.Bottom line, if you can afford to spend more, go for more established brands. Even if you are budget constrained, go for other cheaper brands, as currently the there is absolutely no difference.P.S. this reciew is only for airdopes and not boAt. I have many of their products, and for the money they charged, those gave a satisfactory performance."

"I bought this product in November. Firstly I received a package which was not seal packed. I raised an exchange request and had it exchanged for a fresh piece.But in the very next month, the left airdope stopped charging/connecting/working. Claiming warranty for the same now.Quite disappointed really. Product does not have a working life of even a complete month!Similar thing happened with my Boat stone 1000 speaker as well. Lost trust in boat altogether now."
"Pros:1. Seemless bluetooth connection.2. Looks cools3. Decent noise cancellationCons:1. Bad sound quality, every songs feels very plane, like no bass nothing.2. Ears feels very itchy and ear pain starts after using it for longer than 30 mins.3. They don't hold on ears while exercising and especially while running, mine dropped thrice while running a single lap.4. Even while gymming it keeps on losing the grip from your ear and every other minute you will be adjusting them."
"The music sound quality and bass is exceptional for Bluetooth eardbuds under 2500. The bass can be overpowering sometimes though. I got it for 2000 in a lightening deal.The call quality is manageable but not superior as there is distortion on the listening end.It has a type C port,  battery of the buds lasts for about 4 hours in one charge and the case supports about 5 charges.It may seem that there is no battery percentage indicator on the case except for the single light but it actually changes colour according to the percent left.The earbuds are very comfortable and fit in all ear sizes due to the replaceable rubber fans."
"The most important feature which a low budget tws must possess is a great sound and this one hits the bulls eye in sound and music experience. Awesome and tight bass, one can hear all musical instruments playing in a balanced form. I had used boult, infinity, gionee , crossbeats and mivi but no one beats this.Just go for it..."
Noise cancellation is superb in these Airdopes. The bass is also very good. The treble could be improved further but I am happy with the overall output at this price point. It charges quickly & the case looks and feels good. I am comfortable wearing it for about 90 mins at a stretch. Grips well. Good for walking and other workouts but I guess not the best for running/sprinting.
Could be better for the price. The charging power compartment has a cover that doesn't perfectly fit. There is a few second lapse when controlling songs from airdopes.After 1 week of usage:there is lapse in sync roughly every minute when connecting with laptop. There is a pause and then audio resumes
"It has very nice sound quality, bassheads will love these range is also decent. But mejor issue is mic. For calls these are not good. Opposite person couldn't hear my voice clearly at all. It was also falling during my handstand workout but also fitting depends on person to person. Overall it a good product if u r looking for just music lisening but for call it's a bad choice."
"I bought this pair of TWS for gyming purpose. And guys this is the best one for gym, it doesn't fall from your ear. Make sure that you put the earphones in your respective pic. See my pic to understand the figure of the earphones when put on the ear. READ THE MANUAL BEFORE USING IT. Buy the BLACK ONE, it's classy and doesn't look cheap. I ordered YELLOW first but it looked like roadside product, not that bad tho. LOL. Then, I replaced it with BLACK.Pros:1. Mind-Blasting Bass. Just AMAZED.2. Perfectly fits. (YES, for gyming)3. 1 year warranty.4. It connects to your device SUPER FAST. FASTER THAN LIGHT MAYBE.5. Lightweight.6. Music Chores are also amazing.7. Type C charger is the best. The case gets full charged just in 1-2 hours.8. And last but not least it's an INDIAN brand.Cons:-1. Many people say that it's mic is bad and call quality is bad. I don't have a girlfriend so there's no need for me to talk on call😂😂LOL. But it's not that bad. MANAGEABLE.Will tell ya after using for some time. Until no cons.JUST BUY IT DONT THINK TOO MUCH. ITS THE BEST."
"What I liked about the product is its quality looking at the price range. For this price range, it does a fabulous job. Good bass, sound quality, can receive calls clearly, listen to music, almost everything I expected in this price.What I disliked about the product is its sensors are on the surface of the bud. Everytime I touch it for placing it properly in my ear, the call gets disconnected. Or the video gets paused.  I cannot sleep on my side on my pillow with both earbuds as the sensor touch gets activated and my video is paused. I am using the smallest ear size of the extra buds given. Otherwise it's a gud product."
"Sound quality is good. Could hear nuances of music well. Bass is balanced. Not overpowering, atleast in the songs I heard. Noise cancellation is surprising at the price point, isolates sounds remarkably well. Volume is good and maintains clarity.In call mic volume and quality is also great. Though slightly on the lower side as compared to a wired headphone. Talking a shade louder helps.Definitely recommend."
"Boat 441 pro is very good product. sound ,bass , noise cancellation is very good.Battery is very long lasting ,I used previous 20 days average time 06 hrs ,till the time only 02 point of battery indicators is drain .I like this product .In 2500 Rs is very good product ,I also used realme buds air Neo and Redmi earbuds  but no one earbuds compare to boat 441 pro,not in  economically but also in quality ( sound,bass,noise cancellation , battery back up)With case above 20 days average 06 hrs daily use.Without case single-single buds average 08 hrs ."
"I was very happy for a week or as the sound was really good but the moment i come out of home, cant take any calls as it catches all background noise!!within a month one of the earbud stop working!! Need a replacement of the product asap.Not to buy this product as there is no Response from seller even after 2 months of follow up.."
PROS :-The massive 2600 mah battery case and power bankBass is superb .It's light weight and it's designBuild quality is good and fits perfectly inside your earsBattery back up is very good and charging speed for the airdopes is awesome it's takes almost only 1 hr 15 mins to charge fully .CONS :-Noise cancellation could have been better as in boatrockerz 255 because I used to wear it even while driving the opposite person can hear you clearly .Could have provided Volume control through touch response.
"Best product I got.Pros•Amazing sound with Bass•There is no noise cancellation but it work properly while calling.•Touch Senssor working Good .•Battary Backup of Both buds (upto 7hr) and Case(not check but not charge case from last 7 day and till it's 50% remaining) Very Nice.•Build quality is just ok.• It Support Reverse Charging I charge my phone work properly.•RGB Light Are Good Looking .Cons• Here is cons while using buds there is cinnectivey issue. With my phone only. I checked it on other devices . No issues facing with other device . Only face problem with my device. I think there is problem in my phone . In my laptop it works properly.•I got it 2799 it costly but my product is Good quality so it's""Paisa Vasul "" For me.•RGB Light not on while using."
"It is not good for taking calls. Another side is unable to hear you properly and with background noises many times. Always complaint for low voice. To listen music its good one in this budget. Utilizing it for music and movies only. Detailed feedback will share after some time.Also noticed charger lid is very loose.One important point if you want to register your product for warrenty then you will not be able to do so. Reason, product is not listed in dropdown on product registration page."
"Let me tell you this, if you want a decent earphone with decent sound quality and do not worry about warranty and service this is an earphone for you.My scenario,One side of earphone not working within 3 months of purchase.Residing in Chennai and not having a service centre nearby the replacement process has taken more almost a month for me.Warranty says it will replace the device 'n' number of times. But if your product fails 2-3 times within a year and you have to get it replaced remotely and lose almost 2-3 months without using the product what good is the product in the first place?This clearly makes BoAt products highly suceptable to failure within warranty and buying time within Waranty period through the replacement is just simple solution for them.Unreliable and waste of purchase is how I'd put in one line."
"Sound quality GOOD. Bass super. Touch sensitive, sometimes we feel irritated because of touch sensitivity, And if we get used to it it will not be a problem. Design is good nice box for charging. Sound quality is worth the price paid.. Simply awesome.. Let me test for 7 days because of 7 days replacement policy.."
"This time , i got good product , but again i have some issues with my product .. That is the product box which is  bit loose . While opening , it simply open, like my previous box it was way enough tight . Pardon for this time again creating issue.. But i really need a quick service.. please help me out"
"fantastic and for the price worth a buy. Fits snuggly in the ear, ample noise cancellation, sound quality excellent and good time for talking or listening music. The case also charges quickly and provides for 3-4 times charge."
"The ONE issue which I REALLY hate is that whenever I use this ear buds on my OnePlus Nord for any calls(Watsapp or mobile calls), it automatically looses connection for 5-6 seconds and the reconnects back. In a call duration of 4-5 minutes, this ear buds have done an outstanding job of disconnecting atleat 8-9 times.I have stopped using this for any calls.However, it works perfectly fine for any videos and musics"
"Go for it if you are looking for battery life and sound quality. Will not recommend for calling purposes but one of the handy pic for media purpose.Battery is beast ,once charges will work for a week if headphone used for 2 hours everyday day.the headphone battery works for 3-4 hours on single charge.There are 2 major drawbacks1- No fast charging option2-No as good for calling purpose"
Only one bud is giving sound. Right side bud not giving sound.I put request for replacement and vary next day got replacement. Now both esrbuds are working ok and having very good sound quality. Fully satisfied with product quality and Amazon service. So now I am giving deserved 5 star rating
"First 7 days, the product is awesomeThen things start going a little disturbing, like bluetooth range doesn't work even after 2 mtrs, media volume becomes low, mic volume becomes very disturbing while talking etc. etc.Post return period is over, it starts showing the true colors. Currently, I can't talk while travelling, the other person doesn't understand anything I say. Bluetooth range is less than 1 mtr. With full media volume from my mobile I feel there is very less sound. Talking with this airpods is the worst thing to do during an official call.So overall my suggestion is not to waste your money, better go for JBL atleast they so not compromise on product quality."
"If you are in search of a best TWS earbuds under 2000 then you can check this product . The sound quality is awesome , bass is in proper balanced amount , product build quality is good, battery backup is also good of approximately 3 to 4 hours easily with high volume . You will feel that this product is fully worth of money. This product has touch controls and RGB light too. So don't overthink about this product just buy it ."
"This product has been a nightmare for me. Even with the usage of just 30-60min a day, it is causing pain in the Ears. It was as if the earplugs were capturing my whole ear. Even after taking out the plugs, you will feel them as if they are still there due to the impressions left by it.This was the first time I tried truly wireless Earphones and I resorted to Neckband type after this bitter experience. I would suggest the buyers to go with Neckband only as it is not feasible in many ways."
"This product is not Good for calling Purpose , and if you work in public areas it will give a pain in a.... to the person you are talking with . I will give some pros and cons to tell you after my use of 22 days.Pros -1. Good battery life (~ 18-20h)2. Comfortable shape ( of the box) to put in pocket. It’s not bulky3. Good for music in this price range.4. Solid( I have dropped some time but nothing happened)Cons -1. Voice quality on call is not good , people I call complain that is looks like echo sound as if I am in a small room. I compared it with my boult neckband and really it was terrific.2. Noise cancellation is the most disappointing factor, even in cycling the air sound is so much that my voice is not clear ( you can’t hear anything) then forget about bike. I was in canteen and told to my friend to record the call, when I heard it ,I was not  able to get any of my word.3. They are in ear type , So they fit to your ear and seal the ear canal , so I hear my own voice While talking and it’s frustrating, may be it happens to every tws but with this I can’t use both the ear piece. I usually use one of them otherwise I hear my own body movements , I can hear my steps during walk internally .4.no  Volume Adjustment. Though I dint feel any prob with this5. If you are laying down in bed due to the touch by ear your call may disconnect sometime. ( don’t know this is prob or not but it happens with me sometimes)6. When I put back my earpieces back in box one of  the ear piece (left one ) does not start charging some times. I have to adjust it. I don’t know if this prob is with my product only."
"I was really impressed by the fast delivery as it arrived today (24th oct) and it was expected to be delivered on 27th October.I was very impressed by the sound quality also.Then I charged if for an hour and agin used it after 10 min left earbud stoped working, ok I thought it may need to get fully charged first.I charged it for almost 5 hours and then for a try I started a 3 hour long movie after 2 hours it starts notifying for low battery, and after 10 minutes again the left earbud stopped working.I will again review after a week use if it will remain the same, I may need to return it, like for real.Edit- 12-jan-2021In starting it gives me hard time but somehow it became a part of my day to day but still the calling things is bit annoying.Battery time is still very nice. Once charged it may goes for upto 3-4 hour on playing.Charging case is working smoothly."
"The sound quality is pretty good, base is pretty good. Noise cancellation 8.5/10Touch sensitivity not upto the mark. Just after 2 days it's not working properly. As I tried to change the music track by double tapping on the right one. Nothing happened even after several attempts of tapping, reconnecting etc. Thinking to return this and buy another company's ear buds"
"Overall excellent product.Can't keep in ear for long duration like more than 2 hrs.Excellent battery backup of PRO Airdopes, 16 days and still not charged the box and half charging still remaining, and 4 hrs of in-ear for buds.Bass loving people product.I have earphones of boat which perform better with all aspects of sound quality than these airdopes except for base.Music experience is 7/10.Good for gym, good ear fit.Connectivity is great.Audio quality during calls is 8/10.Touch is very sensitive for buds.Will update on noise cancellation with more usage and other issue if any.Extra Advantage for PRO - You can charge your mobile also, case acts as power bank also(2600 mah), but not recommended to use by boat unless an emergency which is weird."
"As long as you need only bluetooth headsets for workouts these are the best fit but if you think your wired earphones going to replaced by them , you are wrong . The bass is too much that it literally get over every other sounds..there is no lows . You can't even hear a good song and enjoy it .. like they just made it for bass and I'm an audiophile. I only use them during workout . And Mic quality isn't that good . Overall it's good tws ONLY FOR WORKOUT. don't expect more in this price range"
"I write review after 2 months, the following experience I would like to share with you1 light weight2 easy to fit your ears3 sound cancellation is quite ok but good4 sound quality is very good bass also dam good.5 when you active on your call, your oppositors  could be hear your all sourounding sound."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 If you want tws only... you can purchase it.If you want any Bluetooth experience .. best suggestion is neck band ... Not heavy one .. and light weight bands like op bullets z ...Neck bands are easier to carry and maintain .. but in case of tws very hard to maintain .. if you lose one ... LOST 😒BATTERY 🔋: battery is the main topic in tws they will stop working definitely in one year .. charging case will work fine but imagine small buds with tiny battery will fail easily because it's very small ... The buds battery will come to zero in like 5-20 minutes (max)"" Vivekam tho alochinchandi .. alochinchi konukkondi ""Sound quality is 🌟 6/10Bass quality is  🌟8/10Noise cancellation 🌟2/10Bad noise cancellation ... High bass in sound and it decreases clarity in the musicCalls are fine in quality .. buds microphone 🎤 works pretty fine ... ...."
"I am writing this review after using it for almost 3 months....It's just a avg product in the given price. Sound and ease of use is good...But it's very delicate product... If you intent it for rough use... I wouldn't recommend it.Its not for Gym... Sweat and movement can damage it, as it did for me.... You need to be careful not to drop it... Once dropped and you will exp issues.Fit to the ear is also just avg. I can't put it on for more than 30 - 40mins...But it's a good option for decent usage in the given price."
"Very very poor battery back up, only 1 hour of audio music playback time, after that right side of the earbud says oops battery low, even on mobile it shows 80% left.poor quality, after using the product for 4 months, right side of the earbud stopped working. Tried resetting it, worked but now I can't even change the song by tapping it twice. So I suggest to everybody that don't waste money on this poor quality product."
"I have been using this product for almost a week. My review is divided into 3 parts. music , calls & Battery life.1) Music: I have noticed that the sound quality is decent. I would say that the bass is not too high as per my previous experience with boat. It's nicely tuned. The lows are nice than they used to be. The high pitch notes are little bassy when you tune your volume little high.2) Calls: Works well for most telephone/whatsapp calls. When I use this for online calls with video conference like Google Meet, the audio starts to crack. I don't think it's a connection issue as I have a pretty fast connection for a household. So the issue could be with the earphones itself. Other than that I don't have any issue with this.3) Charge: Looks decent as of now. On 90% I roughly use it for an hour or two and see that I will have some where around 50-60% left. I haven't tested the full single charge test nor the entire capacity of the charging case as I don't use it continuously. Will update once done.Final verdict. Decent buy as I got it for Rs:1800. Any thing more you might have to look for alternatives."
"It’s ok as per the price, slightly difficult to take calls since mics are not sensitive and you need to speak louder.Good for bass heads, decent in this price range. The comfort should have been better.The case is with 2600 mah battery and usually lasts for 4 days with average usage. The buds last for around 4-4.5 hrs."
"Its been a while i used this product and to be honest,  Sound Quality is just too good to ignore among the big techs out there..Worth the 2k+ for the eardopes.i really get annoyed accidently touching the sensor in it , sometimes prolonged touches cause it to turn that one side off..since its an eardope or id say truely wireless it tries its best to capture our voice while audio calls, which makes entry for a ton of noise disturbances to enter..especially ive heard my friends complain about very muffled or breaking kind of voice while im using eardopes to call them.If its for media purposes go for it great sound quality"
"Product look and feel is good, noise cancellation, Sound clarity is also not bad for the price. Colour full lighting on the ear phones is also catchy. Bought for 2500..it even cheper wotht he offer going on now..Drawback..cant answer when u get a call on whatsapp or any other internet voice and video calls. Have to take a phone to answer. Hope they improve this facility..and i did not find any specific software that can enhance this feature"
The sound quality is good. the charge also keeps up as saying its closeout full noise differs from the size of the earDue to its coverup or closing ear completely. not recommended for the road while walking it's like the ear went deaf unless the music off no outside voice bass quality is also good
"Sound’s great. Noise cancellation is on point and bass, is fantastic!The touch sensitive system is a little irritative as whenever you take out the airdopes either from the ear or the case, accidental touch plays music automatically on device.Look wise, the lights on the airdopes are a little cheap looking, but, you won’t believe what you’re getting at this price!"
"Overall the product is great and Sound quality is awesome as I used for 4 months.I really loved this BoAt AirDopes 441 but I am sorry to say that after using it for 4 months the right side Airdope stopped charging and can't use it now.Actually, the Brand is from India but Made in PRC(China) and Electronics things don't last long and can't predict when they die.So Guys, one advice -  please think before buying"
This is my first airdopes after just returned 311v2.....this is much much better in all ways..... And the most amezing part is secure fit and comfort ...... After continue using 3 hours there is no pain or hedeche and battery backup is also good around 4-4.5 hours and bass is enough not too much which cause hedeche. Design is awesome and magnetic case with matt finish looks really good and the colourfull lighting during charging or playing increses the facination and coolness of tge pods....... If you wanna buy a promicing and quality product in 2-2.5k range you can definitely go for it without any doubt.
"The product is not compatible with MS teams, or any online call facilities when connected from laptop. Not able to hear from the other side. Also there is about 1 second pause randomly every 10 mins. Not satisfied with this product. I previously had boat rockers 255 which worked fine with all the devices . I cannot replace this product as replacemet period has expired . Amazon / boat please suggest."
"Nice product by Boat,I have used JBL Bluetooth device even but Boat Airdrop 411 is Amazing.. after one Weak Use yes tuff to connect both bud with each other but once you took both bud out from charging case and after waiting 5 to 10 second.Double Tab on both bud will connect with each other sound Quality is Nice Bass is Good even Amazing Nice noise cancellation Power Backup is Nice for bud and ear buds it's last for 7 to 10. days on daily use Nice Rang.I have tried with 12 to 15 meter, it's working you can incoming call voice but with 10 meter range it works perfectOver I can say those who di like this..should use and review this one again.* I give 4/5"
"It really a very good earbuds for everything but their is one problem u have check whether its original or fake earbuds. In first day buying earbuds just for check whether is work for 20 hrs its works than okay u lucky to original earbuds over its very good in everything like use in gym,running,etc ."
Pros:Customer service was good Becoz after one week of using I got problem with airpods like one side is not working and also not connecting to bluetooth so they took responsibility and  exchanged the product without any delivery fee.We can charge the phones but please don't tryYou can avoid the headphones wires for sometime  which will annoy and makes impossible to move from the place.Airpods takes 2 hours to charge and gives the 4-5 hours playtime maximum and sometimes not.Good fit in the ears - No problemCons:Not so good bass qualityNot so good Noise cancellationNot so good soundNot so good productNot so good experience for 2699Not connecting to bluetooth after one week and also one earbud problem.Not giving the playback time 150H with charging case (i.e 80H only)Don't use it for charging the phones bcoz it will degrade the performanceNot for those who uses airpods more hoursOverall experience was below average
"Its so so good, here's what you should know1 it fits like it belong in my ear( usually I always have problem making earphones fit)2 its so comfortable3 connectivity is good and long ranged4 there is no problem with individual buds ( like one of them works different )5 stays long without charging (I've used it for 17hrs so far without charging)6 sound quality is awesomeIve done comparative analysis and at this price this ear buds are the best."
This is a nice product so far .The quality of product is pretty good you will get soft plastics .The sound quality is also good especially for bass lovers .The only thing which seem to be missing is the volume adjustment which is not provided in the buds but this do not seem to be a big issue as such.you can use this for hearing music as well as to attend calls seamlessly .Great product from boat
"I got this buds delivered two days back and used it to the max to check how much its worth. Below are findings..Pros:1. Sound is pretty good, but i feel the bass is little boosted.2. I like the mic noise cancelling, it cuts the background noise (like air, fan and some little noises), i tried while riding my bike, buds mic catches bike motor sounds. So, perfect for home environment.3. Battery backup was good, it got the full potential of 35mAh in both the buds which long for 4 and half hours4. Box battery 2600mAh can charge buds for more than 20 times.5. Charging time for the buds from Oop’s battery low to full is 1hr 15 minutes.6. These buds cant remember or recognise last paired if you keep changed with devices7. Bluetooth range is good, i connected these to my smart tv and can still listen even though tv is 10 meters away. (Two rooms between)8. Just slips into your pocket, but its a little big. (We should compromise battery life with the size and weight of the box)Cons:1. Yes, there is a buzzy sound in the left bud, which gets a bit low while you are listening something and gets a bit high when you pause the audio.2. Buds are little uncomfortable, they are big for me even with the small size bud caps.3. Buds battery life is fine, but case battery is not as promising as said (150hours approximate 30 charges)4. Keeps disconnecting when i try to connect these to my laptopGot these in sale for ₹2,499"
"First of all, the sound and bass quality is what you're looking for, then this is not the one. Everything is average. Noise cancellation is not a feature but it does drown out external noise very well. Battery life is amazing and the power bank cum charger is very useful.But......-It loses connection to phone from time to time, one earbud does not work half the time, it's not broken as a simple factory reset will remove these problems but be ready to do that many times.- People with oily ears beware.- all the tws earphones at this price range are same in terms of quality, the power bank is the only redeeming feature.Lower your expectations a lot and this product is really good."
First of all I would like to say that the speed of dilevery was pretty good and was two delivered 2 days before the promised date. Thumbs up for that👍It is a wonderful product and gives awesome sound quality. The bass is thumping and hence good for bass-lovers...Also the connectivity is very good and it paired with my phone under 20 seconds... It is also very firm once it's in your ear and won't come off easily...Touch sensitivity is also outstanding...Overall good quality plastics are used and it's nice of Boat to include the type-c cable instead of the micro USB...These TWS justify their price...Happy with the earphonesMy rating: 9.7/10
"Never expected this kinda quality in this price!Bought this 3 months ago.Sound quality is really awesome. Even the voice call clarity is great. Sound Effects - No questions! It's Boat, pal. Bass quality is wonderful comparing to other product. Noise cancellation is OK.Battery backup - If we use continuously for listening music or watching movie, it will last for 5 hrs.Charging - Time taking to charge the case upto 3 to 4 hrs and the Airdopes will take less than half an hour to get fully charged when you kept it inside the case.Touch Responsive is superb. Till now working good.The only demerit that I found is, if I use it for long time (above 4 hrs) then my right ear starting to feel a mild pain.So, I'm giving overall rating 4/5."
"Worst Product!! 😡😡 Don't buy it at all.Usually I don't write any review of the product but this product cost me so much trouble that it is worth mentioning. I brought BOAT AIRDOPES 441 PRO(SPORTY BLUE),the sound in the Right Earpiece got diminished within 10 days of buying the product.So I claimed warranty service from BOAT. They got the product replaced but the procedure is so hectic that it almost took 1 month to get replaced. After using it for another 2-3 months the same problem began to rise but this time in both the earpieces.I got so annoyed that I stopped using the product. After few days I again claimed warranty service( since it of 1 year manufacturer warranty) and the process is still going on.I am surprised that such a terrible product is sold by such a reputed company like BOAT.By the way other features like sound quality,noice cancellation and bass quality is OK and upto the mark."
I think I am unlucky with this product boat Airdopes 441 baught this for 1999 1 St I got the product and has an problem on left side eardops had an iritation and requested for an replacement.and I got an replacement product on the next 3 days and the same iritation has on the right Airdopes so requested for an refund going for an another model .I am having all models of boat headphones 3 models I am having but unhappy with this product
"It's good for phone calls and podcasts but I wouldn't suggest this for music. I've noticed this problem with a few earphones before. The Bass is so much that all the other parts are somewhat muffled. You cannot listen to what the Music Producers actually composed the songs to be like.But the packaging, look and style is very good. It also fits well to your ear."
Guys...Excellent sound quality and Bass...I had a Jabra active 65T before worth 15K...the quality of this boat at 2.5K is much better...I am very happy that an Indian brand has started producing world class quality...way to go Boat...just march on with your products and quality ....Indians will follow..👍👍
"Bought the Boat 441 Airdopes for ₹1999/- (Prime day Sale)This is my first pair of TWS earbuds, so I dont have anything to compare it with although the following review entails my experience as a user :Pros-1. Noise cancellation is amazing! Active and passive, both.2. The bass quality is really good too, and I found instrumental separation good on listening to some music.Cons-1. Despite changing the earbuds and the wing to the smallest size, it hurts after wearing these airdopes after just half an hour. Ultimately, I removed the wings and that fits much better but makes it more easy to drop these tiny tiny airdopes2. The CTC takes some time to get used to, there's a lag between touching the sensor and the song getting paused/changed.3. My airdopes spontaneously disconnected a number of times.4. (The worst of all) - there's a sort of buzzing noise in the left airdope. I'm sure it must be a problem with mine but it's still disheartening to have spent 2000 rupees on technology that fails you. (I have placed a replace request)All in all, these are a good pair of earphones to own but since it's a very subjective feeling of fit and comfort, you will have to be careful while using them and making the decision whether you like them or not."
"Everything is perfect except loudness of sound, because bass overshadowed the quality of sound ( mid, low, highs ), and output is 70 % bass, i like the balanced sound of Ptron Urban, though it is far cheaper than boat 441. So if you are bass fan, go for boat 441, otherwise choose another one, which delivers balanced sound like oppo enco w11. Rest is your choice"
Very nice audio you can also use alexa with it if you set alexa as default for that you should install alexa app and sign in with your Amazon account sound is very nice it is only 2499/ very nice this is best compared to boat 171 the newly released one

 Thy are jst awesome... Worth fr the price... Awesome sound quality as well as bass quality... Noise cancellation is pretty good...!Im more than satisfied..What are u waiting fr..!?Add these babies to ua carttt..."
"Very cheap product. Just looks nice, that's it. When it comes to sound, it is just artificial, over powering bass. And I actually like strong bass!However what is worse is the manufacturing defect that quite a few other people have also mentioned - left earbud has a constant hissing / crackling sound. I got a replacement as well which had the same problem!Thanks to Amazon's stellar customer service I was able to return the replacement as well for a full refund.I'm however never buying products from this company."
"Blue colour are very good and best feature of this price is worth in this price segment.Durability :- 5/5Quality :- 4/5Design :- 3.5/5Easy to carry or not a bulky , and worst thing is this product is  bit of irritating start after 20 minutes usage because eardopes are heavy weight for ear .I review after usage 3 month .Battery life of eardopes is 4 hours approx. , and charging case of battery backup is 20 days after normal usage.Last thing is very good for ₹2000 price range , but I purchase it in ₹2500 , so sadly I think it price is not more than ₹2000 .not fit dual screen case very well until when you hard to push and back to out dual screen case and last thing is that other pockets of this cover which are too much tight to fit anything else."
"Review of boAt Airdopes 441 TWS:I had ordered the Airdopes on 29th October, 2020.To be honest the sound was not that good. Also the touch response was laggy.After 2 months,  left ear-drop stopped charging so I registered a complaint. Please note that it took about 15 days to get the product replaced. Also, they don't claim to replace the product with new Airdropes; most of the times it's refurbished.  *Do read their warranty policy before making purchases of any of the Boat's products.To my surprise the sound quality of the replaced unit was better than the previous unit; That means they don't have quality control and every airdrop sounds different.  But obvious the product is made in China.After 10 days of usage again the Airdropes started to sound weird. The sound from the left Airdrop sounded low and muddy; the right one produced buzzing sound when nothing was played.Have initiated the replacement process, but till date haven't received the replacement.I generally never write reviews; but writing this review so that others can make informed decisions while purchasing any of Boat product.After all, it's your money and your decision.Peace!!!"
"So, basically at the starting they seems to be working quite good.1) after 2 weeks, the left earbud started making chhhrrrrr- chhhrrrrrrr sound.2) The noise cancellation is just for fun, because there is no noise cancellation in it and when you talk on a call the person on other side is not able to listen you and you have to disconnect it.3) The ear buds do not fits correctly in the charging case. You have to make the adjustment for ear buds to connect with the case and then charge.4)build quality is just awesome.5) The multi colour lights in it make it look very cheap.6) Literally this one is so Important, Your ears are gonna pain like hell if you wear them more then 20 mins. My ears feels so much pain, seriously This is one of the big problem in it.Now It's your choice. You should buy these or not.😊"
"I purchased the Boat 441 airdopes and found them to be a waste of money.First things first, the packaging, the headphones and the charging box look to be of good build and quality. But that's just about as good as it gets.The volume is extremely low, and call quality is bad too with the person on the other end not able to hear anything or hears lots of distortions. The calls audio quality at my end is good (though very low volume).. till about 70% of the total volume, the quality is average and could barely hear.. it gets better at near full volume.The worst part is Amazon does not support return for this product and only offers an exchange.  I will update should my experience be any better with the exchanged product."
"I bought this CSK edition because I am a huge fan of MSD.The pros are 1. They are portable and fits within a palm2. They give sufficient battery backup to last an entire trip3. They do not get scratched easily and the colour will last4. Excellent customer care service: after 3 months, I asked for exchange because one of the buds was not working so they replaced it within a span of 7-8 days5. It will not fall during heavy workoutThe cons are 1. In my POV, the bass on 90% or 100% seems not to work properly.Giving review after using it for 100 days. May it help other usersI want boAt to make cases and earbuds dedicated to a single person like MSD,VK,SRK,LM10,CR7etc and an football edition too."
"There is a slight disturbing noise in the left ear piece. This noise continues to be there for very long time and stops at its will. Have bought two Airdopes and both of them have the same issue. This persistent noise is so disturbing and annoying , most importantly you can not do any thing about it except switching it off.Overall the product is nice , Great fit , good sound, pocket friendly. But again the disturbing brrrrrrrr noise throws all off all of it.Would suggest to test out the product till the return window is available. I trusted BOAT blindly and bought two of them. Now am stuck with them ."
"Just the best True wireless earphones under ₹1999, there's no comparison. Trust on the Indian brand. Kudos!Everything is just perfect about theseBattery backup, comfort, bass quality, trebles and mids. And the design is elegant, too.Microphone is 4/5, as it captures a lot of background noise, but still good. Crystal clear."
"Sound quality is above average.My other boat wired headset worth Rs 700 has better audio quality.Also, the right earpiece sometimes takes time to reconnect to your bluetooth device if your bluetooth connection is lost for some reason.Edit: revising my rating to 3 stars as speaking on calls via these headphones are difficult. The other side is barely able to hear me"
"First day- when i started using them I loved them like they r awesome but in the evening when I was listening to a song I don't know what happened the song was breaking so I stopped the music and played it again( I was scared that is a faulty product) but it was working well happened once#second day- when I removed the earbuds from the case the left one didn't connect to the right so put them back in the case and closed it and tried to connect it again n they did connect got scared n started search on YouTube of boat airdopes 441 problems so there they said reset it so I did was working fine#third day-went for cycling and noticed that they were breaking the song again . I was thinking to return it next day but then I did reset again n went to hoping it becomes fine tomorrow#fourth day- they were working fine big relief no such issue after that work absolutely fine I guess they were packed for so many time maybe needed so time to get use toPros:- (good bass at 90% if u listen on 100% bass overpowers)👈(wrote this a month after using)(wrote 👉 after using for 7months I don't feel they are overpowered on the bass side now they feel equal or perfect To be precise) and also the loudness depends on the apps you use for listening songs on wynk is good in loudness and bass but Spotify the loudness is not that much2) connectivity- they connect very quickly like no joke really quick3) touch is awesome need some time though to get used to it4)calling is great in house didn't tried it outsideCons:-I don't think so there r any(Will let u know if I face any problem in future. I am scared of those two things that happened in the beginning I hope they don't happen againREVIEW AFTER 7 MONTHS OF USEWork properly but rarely becomes disconnects walking out side at crowded places and once a month while using at home . Water proof is for sure ,got a bit wet while using but they were working normal no issue but there is a problem but it's a minor one I guess sometimes they don't charge full like if I put the earbuds in the case before sleeping n when using in the morning they show 90% charged even when they are in the case over night but when they are placed properly they charge and battery life is also top notch only if they worked on the the quality of the case it would be awesome but still it is a good choice"
"I'm diehard fan of boat. I have positive opinion after reading review on boat airdopes.I'm writing review after using it 20 days.1.Initially bluetooth connection worked around 5 to 6 meters. Now it is limited max 3 meters. If you move moretham 3 meters from device connection will break.2. Both airdopes are working fine if bluetoothcharging is 100%. Right side dope is not working if the charging is 80%. Battery back up also not coming more than 2 hours.3. Not comfortable to make calls. You have to speak very loudly to reach your voice others. Touch is very sensitive. Even if ear pressure is there, then your call will disconnect. If you adjust airdope when you are on call, call will disconnect for sure.4.audio and bass quality also not good compared to boat rockerz.So please think wisely and don't get suffered after purchased it."
Pros:😂Excellent sound output😍Excellent bass😚Premium look & build quality😆Noise cancellation🤩Really like that led feedback on touchCons:🧐Slight issue in paring😏Some time you feel sound is not enough & Noise in 100% volume😤Touch is good but sometimes it is annoying if you touch unfortunately👂Ear started Paining in long time use⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Overall recommend to buy because you couldn't find any decent earpods in this price range. 😘
"The battery is very poor, lasts for maximum of 2-2.5 hrs . The design is such that it fits well in the ear but ear starts paining after using it for an hour. The touch is super sensitive , so any slight touch by mistake keeps changes the song, so u can rarely use it while lying down. The sound quality is also not great. Not at all for calling purpose, microphone doesn't work well."
After 15 days of trial i am giving my reviews. Guys not worth for 2k. Sound quality is decent but call quality is pathetic And not something worth trying..1. Bass quality is good2. Sound quality decent/ Average3. Call quality - 0 starsThe person receiving the phone on other hand can't listen to what I sayPls don't buy this product
I bought this product on 03.09.2021 -- Now am facing issue from past few days. The charge is not holding. Within 10 minutes am hearing message opps low battery charge. Also when I disconnect and connect the speaker doesnt work.Have sent email to customer care. Let's see.
"The base is best in class. Sometimes at max volume, you might feel thw voice to too sharp..but it happened with just 1-2 songs. Also the loudness is not veryyy high (6mm drivers), but was more than adequate for me."
I got this product exchanged once thinking I had got a faulty product but the quality of the product is very poor. The mic is very poor as people complained to get very low noise on the other end. It stops working abruptly while listening to music and I have to disconnect and connect again for it start working. Long way to go Boat.
"Sound output is okay-ish, not too loud not too low and the bass? not so much up to the mark. My main complaint about the item is the mic. Like when you take calls, the other person cant hear you. The voice out output on the other end is not totally distorted but its not clear either. I picked this in t he sale so its okay. I'd recommend not to but at the normal price."
"Best deal & worth for moneyPros1. Sound quality is amazing highs & lows are perfectly audible2. Batter back is good in this segment3. Small in size & easy to carry battery caseCons1. Voice is missing when it gets paired or when phone rings, you'll only hear small beeps onlyI used different earbuds before where in u hear a voice when the phone rings & it tells u an incoming call number2. Battery case could be of metallic than plastic"
"I bought it during big billion day sale for Rs. 1949. I have a prime membership, so I got it for this price. I used this product for one whole day, Bass is really good, but when you call anybody using this, noise goes out. So not recommended for those who wants to use it for calling. For music lovers, its really good in this price.I have an issue of some noise in right airdopes. Whenever I listen to music, some noise comes in the right one."
"Ok now these dopes are quite nice , good bass but not that extra bass , while in other pods we have to use both as to connect the right or left as in Sony wf xb700 but in this u can use individual,  if u put only one then tracks move forward on tapping 2 times and with both it is awesome  and yes one bad thing is that it is kind of slow , like if I am playing track and I keep my phone to sleep after some time the track run fast at some places , I meant  that they are not able to cope up with the speed of phone .Thanks to all the viewers,  should buy until u need it professionally. If u need professionally then go for "" SONY WF-XB700"""
"Good product with working and charging time as described. Used it regularly for a month. The ear piece rubber inserts can fit most people as was the case with me. My ear lobes used to pain with the larger ones.Had to change to smaller one and fits gr8 for 4 hrs straight battery time. Its sturdy,  have dropped it many times.  The touch is very sensitive.Only issue i have is the sound quality at low volume. At higher volumes, its an absolute delight with amazing sound clarity. U wont even hear sm1 talking next to u!!! Be careful when outdoor as u wont hear any outside sound.. Would highly recommend it!"
"This is going to be a detailed review so please read it carefully :I was using my wired earphones and thought of upgrading and so I bought this earbuds during winter sale for rs2000.Pros:-1. The case has a matte finish which looks very good and due to its pebble design it's easy to hold.2. It has a type c port which is helpful as all the smartphones now come with a type c port so you don't have to search your cable again and again.3. The earbuds are completely made up of plastic and so are lightweight.4. The fins on each of the earbud is very helpful as it prevents the buds from falling. I did various exercises and running and they don't fall out.5. Battery life is quite decent on the earbuds. They last upto 3 and 1/2 hours on 60% to 70% volume. The battery backup on the case is really good. I was able to charge the buds 5 times with the case from 0 to 100%.6. The base is very good and punchy which made it sound better.Cons:-1. At this price range they could provide more battery on the buds.2. Due to the small size of the drivers the volume is low. You have to keep it at 70% to listen clearly.3. The sound is not well balanced, it is shifted more towards the base.4. The ears start paining after a long term usage but you will get a hang of it after a while. Also there's an extra fin available which is smaller than the pre installed one so you can switch to it as it's more comfortable (it may depend).5. The hinge on the case is a little bit fragile so use it carefully.6. The product is made in china although boat is a indian brand.At last I would say that at this price range it's a good pair of buds."
"Pros:1. Super sound. It has Great Bass.2. Noise cancelation is awesome. You can hardly hear surrounding noise when volume is at higher side.3. Fits perfectly in the ear.4. Looks premium.5. Connecting with phone is flawless and also pause, play, next song option on earpod is great.Cons:1. My left earpod had some tingling noise when video is playing but volume is low or zero. This was really irritating and I replaced the earpods. The replacement one were better.2. The biggest Con I came across is, this does not work during live video calls... E.g. Zoom meetings. The zoom meeting gets stuck, voice is not heard and simply staggers the audio&video. Once I disconnected the earpod the zoom meeting was back to normal. I tried this multiple times. Not sure if earpods are not meant to work for live video calls, but this one does not seem to work."
"Right eardope stopped working within 2 weeks.Since the return window was just a week, was told to connect with boat customer service.The customer service staff reads from a script and is taught to ignore what the customer is saying.I was told to write to customer service, asking for a refund (just 80% of the value I paid 2 weeks back).That's the price of buying a CHEAP PRODUCT like boats.So I agreed in desperation, but no response whatsoever from the customer service id.I have in the past bought JBL and SONY earphones without any issues whatsoever.. my mistake I trusted a brand like boats.MOST LOUSY PRODUCT. PLS STAY AWAY."
"First Of all i am a big fan of boAt product its well known for good sound & bass. The product is really awesome in terms of build quality, sound & noise cancellation. Even the touch response is so superb you dont have to pull your phone continuously From your pocket for changing the songs.About the battery it's pretty much better as its Atlast for 3.30 hours of continuous usage.The major feature is the bluetooth connectivity where you need not wait for pairing each time ,once Bluetooth switched on it automatically connects.!!!Overall i am really happy for this product & It’s really value for money also."
"Good product in 2499 Rs. Sound quality is good, not best but good for daily use.Noise cancellation is not that good, on call other person can hear everything which surrounded by you.Bass quality is best, this is specifically designed for bass lover, infact I'm using equilizer to control bass.Overall design is good, it fits in ears easily.Touch sensitivity is too high, but you can find latancy while using touch for play pause and next track.2500 mah battery is useful thing, you need to charge once in week if you are using daily with more than 5 hours.Everything is good except the making country.It's made in P.R.C"
"Being and Indian we have taken lead to use Made In India products, but unfortunately received the product made in China. Also I was very excited to get the access as soon as I unboxed and tried to connect only one bud got connected I tried every possible way to make the bud work but unfortunately Chinese vendors have indirectly made u lower your business. Only because you are getting your products made at cheaper quality you are following Chinese vedors you are loosing your Customers. Charge more but make in India and give the best quality to keep your Brand going.. Never expected this kind of product from a growing International Brand. Hope this will bring change otherwise China is definitely bringing you down... #BoycottChinaGoods."
"Giving review after 10 days of using. Nice product. Battery life is awesome 🤩 but using only one airdope and replacing other 😅 over a time. No volume control 😠. Touch is so sensitive as just a slight touch will end the call which makes us feel uncomfortable. Excellent for gaming any kind of games especially for PUBG lovers 😍. Material used for airpodes is so nice as accidentally I dropped by airpode from 1st floor to ground floor which directly fallen on the Road, but aftet using it it worked nicely no problem in hearing and no scratches and no cracks which makes me happy about airdopes. 2600 mah battery is so nice which makes us to take any were going out not bothering about of charging and current cuts. For music lovers also it is so good with good bass but not excellent. If u are music lover and listen most of the time they are excellent as they give more battery life by managing the airpodes using two for some time and keeping one airpode for charging. Overall it is very good product with excellent battery life, Good bass, Good Long range bluetooth connection, Very good quality of product. But only problem is No volume control 🙄😡."
"Bass quality is not that gr8...it's like normal ear phone..u can get such quality in every ear phone of up to 500 rs..Noise cancellation is almost not working in this ear buds..the other person can clearly hear the surrounding noise even if u r on bike, the person can hear air passing sound..overall the sound quality is ok...but I really liked the touch system, lighting and it's adaptation to ear.. built quality is really good and tough even if it fall from25 feet, it works perfectly without any damages to ear bud,,u can buy at this price.."
i Got the headphones just as an alternative to my bose Sound sports of course i am probably comparing them to those but the volume in these headsets are just not there .. There are times that i go for long cycling rides and i require more than a pair of wireless headsets to keep me going for longer so as a secondary i bought these. The build is obviously cheap and not that great i recommend if you can spend a little more to go in for the Jabra Elite 65t @ 5999 they are a 100 times better and almost the same quality as the bose .. so make your choice 3k more for the jabra..
Pros:1. Product is good for listening songs or watching movie.2. Connectivity is very fast.Cons:1. For phone calls. It's not good as you can't talk on it outdoor as it has too noise and person on another side barely hears you.2. Voice breaks often on call. Can only use in a peaceful place or small room.3. Battery of earphone dies in less than an hour whipe on call.4. While playing music earphone dies in less than 1.5 hours5. Not for playing PUBG as voice lags by 2-3 seconds.
"A perfect buy... For some days so many people told me not to buy this one...but after using it I can tell you all that this is one of the best products in the market. It may not have a big brand name like Sony, JBL, Bose, Sennenheiser in its category but worthy... And at this price range its awesome. Thank you Amazon, Thank you Boat.. Keep the quality assured."
Sound quality is amazing and I love the bass in my airdopes 441 I ordered pro model first but the bass quality is doesn't meet the normal 441 I don't know what the company brought with 441 pro other than just battery...and most imp thing is 441 pro model has less battery in buds than normal 441 ..pro had 35 mah and normal 441 has 43 mah...so you get most out of your buds ...Pro model case is big little difficult to handle....I don't about you all...But for me battery is not a problem...Sound quality is imp for me...in 441 airdopes I felt I was in out of this world in 441 pro that feel is missing..Don't you think comfort and feel is more imp than batteryIf you are like me go with just 441
Given 4 star as fell from my balcony at 18floor and working 😂. Otherwise just an okay product. Sound quality just okay not impressive. While listening to music there no background noise however if you are on calls then other person will hear your background noise more louder than your voice that's one drawback. Otherwise worth in that amount
"Purchase 3 no.s. for all my family members. Fits perfect Galaxy Ear buds rubber grip (Ear grip that comes within box feels bit cheaper) Sound Qulity and Bass effect at its best. Since I'm using 2 pairs, no issues with Battery Backup.Only issue is that, at low battery when I try to keep the buds inside the case, it's not getting auto unpaired with device (remains connected even while chrging inside case)The Automatic Pair/Unpair is not that intuitive as compared to Galaxy Buds. But for this price range, exceeded all my expectations."
"Sound and bass is fine.But i am disappointed as initially i was given different model which was not working. Now when I got replacement with 441 model, its mike is not working properly. Receiver receives the echo. It seems that its obesrving the mike of my phone only. Really disappointed. I feel like I made a mistake purchasing this product"
"First of all, it was mighty hard to set up, they have tried to riddle the product with useless features, and because there are A LOT of them, it gets hard to set it up and even harder to remember. Second of all, the primary feature (sound quality) seems to have received ZERO attention from boAt. It is evident since the sound quality is downright AWFUL. Local wired earphones priced from 100-200 rupees, sound way better.TL;DR: Don't buy this product."
Received it today. So used only 1 day. Initial impressions are very good.I baught it for my dad. I use crossbeats pebble.boAt 441 seems very good. Bass quality is amazing. Build quality is very good. Fit and comfort is amazing. Decent call quality.Observed imbalance and noise when i put full volume. I will again comeback to post my feedback after 30 days use.
"The bass quality is awesome. The sound is too good for this price range and we can feel each and every beat. Only con is the feather attached to the buds (added for the purpose of the buds not being fallen easily). It causes slight pain in the ears when we wear the buds too much time. (PS: THIS CAN BE ROMOVED IF WE WANT). Apart from this, these earbuds are worth for money.. Just go for it."
"I am extremely disappointed with Boat and Amazon. I didn't expect to return the earphones due to a buzzing in the left earpiece, just to receive another set with an even worse buzzing in the left earpiece again! I am never buying any Boat products again, as this is the third time I've received bad quality products from them. Also, I am extremely dissatisfied with Amazon's supposed quality control. If a multi-billion dollar company like this cannot handle vendors that provide bad quality products (despite multiple customer complaints on the same issue), then it's better for me to take my business elsewhere!"
"I have purchased this product on 15th January and after a week the Airdopes got stop working. So Amazon is not accepted after 7 days policy. Hence I have contacted to Boat customer care and raised ticket. Product has sent to customer care for fix the issue. Its almost 12 days but still the product is not yet returned.My overall review is ""zero"" why because I have purchased Boat rockerz 400 and boat storm 170 I am very happy with that products because those are non touch based products. here boat airpodes are touch based and boat is not up to the mark to maintain quality touch based products"
"Great product, I didn’t expect these sought of quality product from an Indian company. Much better than apple’s and JBL wired headphones which I was using. Sound quality and Bass quality is awesome. Had to return 1st product due to some issue with charging. Then 2nd product received, is working without any issue. Later I brought 441 pro which again smashed my belief with its power bank facility included with the box and 2600 mAh battery case means only need to charge less frequently compared to 441. Visual battery charge indication in battery case is pretty useful. Sound quality of 441 pro is same as 441."
"When I connect it with the laptop, the connection seems to be breaking, there is a disturbance, I need to reconnect again then it starts working again, if you are thinking of using this as a Mic as well you will be disappointed because another person can't hear you. Other than that your ears will experience pain if you use it for more than 1 hour.Overall I would not recommend this, sound quality is good though."
"So I bought this airdopes for iPhone because spending 12-13k on AirPods is not a good idea, after all , in my case, karni toh mujhe zoom meetings hi hai...Toh the thing is, it looks good, dikhne mein accha hai, sound quality bhi thik-thak hai but your ears can’t take it for more than 10 minutes, 10 minutes mein toh bhaisaab ears pain karne lagte hai."
"Boat climes this 150 hours of playtime but it plays around 65 hours. I have replaced this airdopes twice the experience was same. The replaced airdopes stop working within a week so I made my refund.But but but I'm telling youThe sound quality, The bass, The noise isolation and fit and comfort of this product is absolutely fantastic."
"Pro's : super sound, good volume, doesn't get distorted at high vol, good thumping bass.Easy pair, easily you'll get through a day with just buds, and case is a plus, very handy case, super sleek with elegant classy look. I bought bumblebee yellow, its awesome. Got it in prime day at 1799.Cons : my ears are small, so it doesn't fit in properly, but however it fits now, whatever i do, it doesn't drop, testing jumping, running, skipping many times.One more is, the silicon buds pack your ear and creates pressure in your ear which will feel somewhat uncomfortable after few mins of wearing. The case cap is a bit loose, but you can live with it.Rest i found it worth the money. Sound is amazing, no hissing sound, crystal clear when nothing is playing. It is a good buy."
"I am writing this comment post using this for 4 months,1. First 2 months it was working fine with best sounds quality,2. From 3rd month it started giving issues like sound became low on right bud( it was not increasing even after clicking 3 times.I can give max 3 star for first 2 months,And i dont knowhow to exchange this ( 1 year warranty they have given)Thanks,Jassie"
Fared way better than expected.. Provides good stand by time. Best to use during workouts.The only problem I face is I have to carry the pod everywhere. If I want remove the ear buds then need to very cautious while keeping it if the pod is not around..But may be this the price to use this excellent device..
Best Earbuds. Boat is a reliable brand for Headphones and Earbuds.I have four Headphones (different types) of Boat and quite satisfied with the all the product.Go for it.... It's Value for money.
Even though the product is worth the money but I would to address this particular issue with Airdopes 441 & 441 pro series that one of the bud will either stop charging after a couple uses or it will stop holding enough charge to run for long periods.If they can come up with a good solution to this it will be the best choice in the price range.I have been using the 441 for over a year now but due to the above mentioned problem I had to buy the new ones the 441 pro but to my dismay they also had the same problem just after using for 2 days.If the problem continues I might think of changing my preferences and moving on to find a product that is worth the money I am paying.
"The quality of the product is fair, given the price. It is okay for music and videos only.When I use it for calling the other person complains about voice quality. Also, the bluetooth connectivity is poor.After around two months, some times the sound in one or the other ear gets lost.If you are buying a truly-wireless headphones for the first time, you may go for it. But don't expect a great experience."
"I am writing the review after one month using this product, i bought it in Rs. 1700/- and after all BOAT's overhaul performance superb like that battery backup, bass quality, noise cancellations ect. Thanks boat and thanks Amazon for best service and support."
"The sound quality is remarkable and the bass is satisfying, noise cancellation is tried its best but not good and which makes it even worse is the feature which is malfunction everytime.The problem i faced with this is1.smart turn on/off is not worked2.refresh method is also not working3.charging box is not indicating the correct pattern of light.These are the problem i have faced and i returned it but still now the package is taken by the courier, the date changed again and again but for the third time they promised for advance refund and i got it which is really appreciatable when it comes to amazon customer support. If anybody face problem like me you better contact the amazon customer care."
I had purchased for comfortable hearing wireless. Battery backup is best & voice clarity is also best. This product suits to our daily needs. It has great sound effects & also compact which helps us to carry everywhere.
one of the Airpode is not working after 10 days of purchase and i could not contact dealer for warranty replacement.  i never face such trouble for amazon purchase for the past 10 years. Boat is the standard product and return period may be extended atleast for one month. these are all amazon assured product.
"The aound is still acceptable. Though its bass heavy and starts hurting ur ears if u listen on high volume for long. The connectivity is good. As soon as u open the lid, it pairs with the already connected phone. But with 3 months of usage, the charging unit is not giving full battery backup. The dopes do not settle into the box properly and charging issues. Even after closing the lid, the dopes remain connected with the mobile."
"This is an amazing product🔥🔥Which has many pros and less consPros:-1. Looks are amazing2. Feels sporty3. Best for wearing ingym and other sports4. Bass is extra awesome5. Connectivity is also good6. Colour is good7. Battery works for an week with minimum 8 hours of usage everyday. Now lets come to the consCons:-1. Microphone not upto mark2. The case got scratches easilyBut if these cons dont matter to you, you should  definitely go for it.Amazing product in a good price.Other options available in this range are not upto the mark.I am a boat user for 2 yearsAnd used 3 headsets and 2 Bluetooth speakers which are working greatGo for it!!"
Good  product... Voice and audio clarity is good... But it slips out of your ears sometime and fall down... When in crowd would become a problem.. Water resistant thou ❤.. Also not very advisable to use it while driving..coz of the noise cancellation features can't hear the outside  vehicles and honking
Its worth 2000rs. Nice 👍. Go for it. I'm sure it will not disappoint u. Perfect budget and premium TWS. boat is best. I don't have much sound knowledge. But l know how premium earphones sound is. It's good or bad don't know but here bass is too loud. But feeling nice to listen.And thanks Amazon for quick replacement.@reader- please ask for replacement if the box or product seal is broken. I got product which seal was open and also box lamination was not there. Which I got replaced.
"Honestly I did not like the Boat bluetooth head sets because of few reasons first it has the connectivity issues with Android phones, second unwanted lights on the earpods which shows the cheap quality, third the touch sensor never works on time: few are more about his battery backup and the charging mode. Always blue light remains on while using."
"Cons: Voice call quality is very bad. Other person cannot hear our properly and mic is taking background noise more than our voice so person other side  the call will hear too much noise.Pros: As usual good sound quality. Bass is reasonable. For listening to music or watching movie in mobile or laptop this ear dopes are good.As mentioned, battery backup is damn good.I realised that if we are spending this much we will get this much only. Price and quality matches."
for the price these are goodbut the connection is weakit frequently disconnects for a second or two and the audio skipsbut rest of it is pretty good for the price it is for
"Its a decent product at this price range. Not close to Sony or Jabra, but still better than Mi, Realme, Hammer or philips. Bass is ok, sound quality is good.For prolonged use, ear starts hurting. Otherwise it fits well and doesn't fall during running.Battery backup is good as specified."
It's been exact 2 months today and till now no complain from it.No disconnection and no problem in touch you can go for it.the best product under this range.Build quality is absolutely crazy i just hit it so hard on the wall by mistake but boom nothing happened not even slightest damage though both the buds were out of case.Surely you can go for itBuy it and get into nirvana with absolute sound quality and bass quality
"Bought this device in July 2020, when the first lockdown restrictions were lifted and wasn't disappointed. For the price, this device is a god-send and does its job wonderfully. However stressing the device like taking it outdoors for a walk constantly , hampers it so I had to replace the product via warranty 8 months later.Removing 2 stars for the lack of durability; apart from this, it is a perfect device that is from a valuable Indian brand and has superb warranty and sound quality. Just see videos on how to clean TWS earphones and cases clearly as this will help in maintaining the device for a long time. Chinese OEMs are selling TWS for 500/- less that are quite good as well."
"They are very comfortable, worth the cost, they are as solid as any earphones in your ears you can jog, jump, workout comfortable without worrying about them to fall off.The bass quality is very nice.But, prolonged use can cause ear pain, probably cause the whole weight is a bit more than wired ones and is to be bared by the ears; say an hour of using them would be the ""limit"" for me.would i still buy them? hell yeah! they are worth it."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 bass is unexpectedly brilliant, does very very good job in noice cancelation, sound quality is just wow, and talking about build quality, when it was new the case and the buds fell from my hands many times and even the buds were under my feet once but nothing happened, it's not for gamers coz yes it has latency in every game, but i chose this for YouTube videos, Netflix, spotify, gym etc.it's been 4 months and I'm happy with this product."
"Rather difficult to handle and use.  Not very easy on the ear since I felt uneasiness after a few minutes. I have no other brand for comparison and perhaps things will improve as the days go by. Unless you plan to keep it in ear all day long, it would be difficult to handle since the  case is a bit too big for placing comfortably in the pocket.The device is attractively designed and he coloured LED add to the charm. Charging too is as easy as dropping them into the moulded slots in the case."
"Hi, I am really not a big fan of writing reviews in any e-commerce websites. But after spent lots of time & search I thought I can buy this TWS which comes under my budget. Opened this TWS package with a lot of excitement. Oops... To be frank I am not disappointed with music. The bass and vocal is very clear. But the problem comes only when you try to voice command. As per the instruction we need to hold for 2 secs for voice command. So when I do this that's it. My iphone completely hangs and I cannot open any apps. It won't access hey siri voice command at all. I have to manually close my phone and have to open again which is really really disappointing. I would have agree if this could happen with some unknown brand TWS. But with boAt I am completely pissed off. So I have returned my item on the very first and asked for replacement hoping that this could work with new item. But it happened again. Hence I decided have to live with this without voice command option.I used to listen songs during my leisure time. So from sound point of view this is still TWS to buy. Thank you"
"I have purchased this for me, my wife and my brother and we all are very happy about it's performance.5 hours battery back is really good of it. Can watch complete movie and some youtube videos in a single use.It's Look is Stylish and completely fits into ears. Very comfortable to wear.Really Awesome product, I always faith on boAt products."
"Decent product, cant be used continuously even for 30 minutes. I felt very painful in my ears. I have tried using all the ear buds that comes with the product, but it does not meet the real needs of usage. I could use it continuously only for 30 minutes maximum. I had ear pain which I had never felt while using my wired ear phones from apple or AKG ear phones from Samsung. Please check the comfort of such product before considering to buy. Visit stores where you can check the comfort of it which differs to each individual. I messed my ears by buying this product."
Bought it a few weeks back.Ratings.Sound quality : 3.5/5 considering the price point could have been better. Not for hardcore music enthusiast.Bass : 4/5 it is really good. Booming and thumping.Battery : 5/5 satisfied till now. Will know after a few months.Mic noise : 2.5/5 the worst part. People can barely hear you on the other side if you are in a little noisy place.Connectivity : 4/5 no issues once connected. But sometimes sound doesn't come even if you are connected. You need to factory reset if this occurs.Comfort : 3/5 little on the heavier side. Can't  wear for longer time. I guess its the same in other tws.Honestly It is a good buy. I haven't  tried other products  hence can't  compare.
"It claims that it gives 5h battery backup after a full charge but i have checked today one headphone shut down in middle after approx 3hrs, so if you want to use it for long time its not possible the battery is not that good. Also, not much comfortable in ear it hurts in the ear bones if you are using it for longer time period.Overall, sound quality is good and bass is also very good.It's been some day only one side of earbud is not connecting properly already did all the troubleshooting given in the mannual not happy with the product.."
"1. Sound quality is below average at this price point if compared with products similar price range.2. Call quality is pathetic as the mic produces an errie static noise with voice breaking up at the other end of call.3. Noise cancellation is almost ineffective.4. This is the only earbud which doesn't fit properly.5. Sound quality, noise cancellation, bass quality and call quality all are below average.6. Active call/playback time is way less than claimed. Didn't check the battery backup in the charging case.5. I should have returned it but tested the product a little bit late and the return window was closed.6. Should have given 1 star but for brand name and looks I have given 2 stars.7. Now I need to raise the issue with the manufacturer as the product is in warranty.8. For the audiophile this is simple trash. But for regular use you have to read a lot of authentic reviews before buying and please don't get guided by ratings in e-commerce platforms."
"Pros - Excellent Backup of Battery charger which obviously is very nice, Decent sound quality with nice bass effectsCons - 1. Acceptable battery life with single usage on full charge2. I noticed that the moment I insert the earphones in my ears I tend to feel heavy headedness and Headaches which is strange being an avid users of earphones like Oneplus Wireless, Is this becoz of the Noise cancellation?3. Fuzzing sound when we turn on the bluetooth with no sound from right earphone."
I would like to mention the pros and cons after 3 months of usage.Pros:- Battery back up good for the earbuds as well as the charging case. Full charge will give around 3 hours of music.- Quality of plastic okay but one should not buy if priced more than Rs 2000 and if willing to bear with the pathetic customer service in case you face issues even if product is in warranty period..Cons:- After a month of use the left side ear phone sound has decreased significantly which means that the volume of sound is different from right and left side. This cannot be fixed even after factory reset.- After 3 months of usage the right side earphone sound completely stopped and not working anymore.- Worst service center who tell me that since my model is new they don't have spare parts ones to replace or fix the earphones even though the product is under warranty. The answer is sorry even in warranty product cannot be fixed be fixed/replaced as they don's support this model since it is a recent model.- Any emails to official email address provided in Boat website is never acknowledged or replied back.- Customer care does allow you to proceed without a complaint number and local service center are not willing to accept a complaint.- Zero noise cancellation. Putting cotton in your ears will block noise better than boAt airdopes 441 pro. Don't get fooled by noise cancelling used for advertising the product.- The grip in the ears buds does not hold properly and it will fall down frequently if you walk while listening to music. Only good to listen sitting at one place.- You have to switch on phone Bluetooth before opening the case to connect automatically. In case you open the case and later switch on phone Bluetooth it takes multiple manual attempts to connect.- The Bluetooth connectivity starts breaking if one goes more than 10-12 feet away from phone.- Some or the other issues keeps popping time and again therefore factory reset is needed every 2-3 days of usage to fix issues.
"Bought this item mainly to pair with my laptop to attend office calls. The product does not perform well here. For plain music listening purpose by pairing with mobile this is ok but not for official call purpose. every now and then the call gets noisy and the voice gets distorted . With same network infra when I connect my wired headphone with my laptop I get crystal clear sound with no disruption , distortion ."
"This airdopes are superb, classy..... No issue in all aspects of sound quality and connectivity etc except unavailability of ASAP charge, they should have provide in this model too. This has high bass so consumes more battery while listening songs. It's just my experience after 2hrs, I will update after more usage."
"This is my first time using any Earpods. I've seen the reviews saying it's average quality but still wanted to give it a try.I am giving this review after using it for 5 days-LOOKS- This has a plastic body which is expected in this price range. Overall it looks good, neither cheap nor expensive.SOUND- Bass is very good. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT HAS A BUZZING SOUND IN THE LEFT EARBUD! you can't notice it while listening to something but if the music stops this sound can be pretty irritating. Otherwise sound quality is good.NOISE CANCELLATION- Its noise cancelling ability is average.CALL FEATURE- If you're in your home it can work pretty well but outdoors the other person can't hear you properly because the mic catches the surrounding sounds.CONTROLS- The feather touch works well but if you accidentally touch it the music can stop or the call can disconnect. But you can manage after few days of using it.BATTERY- The left earpod is not getting charged!!!! It is always on battery low!In short, these pair of airdopes is doing well in the given price range (below 2K). I got this for ₹1699 in Sporty Blue colour and I'm satisfied with the product."
It's not of good quality. As boat products are good so I bought this but really disappointed. There is no audio while in a voice call or laptop meetings. I had disconnect it and switch to phone audio for the other person to hear me. I complained was but the person suggested to go for factory reset. When I asked it this problem going to occure frequently she was hesitant to reply and suggested for rest everytime I faced this. And now afte almost one month the problem remaons yhe same and above that while listening songs frequently the audio goes off in one or the other bud and keeps on shifting from one to another.
"Pros:1) sound quality good.2) bass quality good.3) noise cancellation good.4) touch sensitivity is good.Cons:1) within 3 days of purchase left earbud  stopped working. I have raised an issue for  replacement it's in the process. Very  disappointedd.2)  volume is not full, you can hear outside sounds even when playing music.Overall I am giving to star ratings because left ear bud stop working on the third day.I am very disappointed."
"I used one day . I found few concerns.1. Airdrops having high sensitivity hence when you touch accidentally,  then it terminates calls or music immediately2. It did not work for my ears,  slipping  down in work out time.Therfore above reasons, I had to return it ."
During initial days of usage it will be good. But after a few weeks it drains so fast.I have used for 75 days now within 25mins it is draining complely and after one charge the case charging going into Red(below 35 %).I bought it for 2500. Now it's like i have paid around 1000 per month which is way too much.Better buy a good branded product.
"*My old review* There comes some random noise instead of actual sound sometimes. All you have to do is disconnect and connect again. You have to do this whenever you face this issue.*My new review* As per their reply to my old review I have sent an email to boAt on 16th-Aug-2020 regarding the same, now it's 7th-sep-2020 and still no response. At the same time, I have checked their social media handles and comments of different users complaining on lack of response from boAt for any warranty/product issue related queries. So compiling all those, I recommend you choose some other brands who offer good service/support and stay free from these headaches. I feel waste of money now."
"I had excitedly purchased boat Airpods for myself as a birthday gift to find the product perfect for my use.Gradually a screeching sound started in the device and it kept increasing. The product being under warranty, I raised a complaint on January 14th and the product pickup was delayed by almost 2 weeks. Finally when i received a replacement, it was a dirty, used and looked like a discarded piece.(images attached) after which i quickly raised another complaint for the same, to which the same delayed pickup was initiated. Finally when i received my 2nd replacement, it turned out to be full of earwax (image attached). I tried shooting an email for this, but the mailbox seemed full.My last resort was social media, and here I am, speechless about the whole situation. Something that was least expected from a company like boat, who is known for their amazing products.#DisappointingService #PatheticService #BoatCustomerCare @BoatNirvana"
"One more Wrost product from Boat, not expected from such company1) Connectivity - 0/52) Mic - 1/53) Batter 2.5/54) Noice cancellation-0/55) Build quality -4/5Need hard reset everytime if you want to pair, when you are in call if you get waiting call automatically buds will stop, it will not give any sound,still it will be in connected mode, if you want to use it again keep in charge box reset and connect againOverall product is below average, many performance issues, wrost experience and there is no return also,only replacement,no use if you replace the same defective piece n number of timesDidn't expect such a product from Boat, and Amazon is promoting such product"
"If you want to buy a good pair of earbuds than go for it.Dont repeat the mistake i did i.e watching reviews and videos of this earbuds before buying as most of them are fake just for getting reviews on thier videos and likes in thier comment.Trust me look wise , fitting wise they are perfect.Sound quality is awesome you dont even need ANC as thier passive noice cancellation is so good.And one important thing to share their is no hissing or any unwanted sound in the left earbuds. Those who are mentioning it are either using low end mobile or else they are lying.I watched movies and listen to many songs its sound quality is superb.*For game lovers - buy it without any hesitation as thier is no latency i just feel like i am playing in wired earphone*Connection speed is so fast*look wise so premiumIf you really want to buy these TWS airdopes 441 PRO go for it you will not regret.*BATTERY  BACKUP  is just as said you will easily get around 5 to 6 hours if using volume at around 50 to 60%."
Take the 441 real true buds the best 😎 ............ Gaming just k..... But other superFull review 10 days after up date.... K
"Awesome sound quality, even when watching movies, excellent fit,Bass is awesome.....and call quality is also good....But Not for pubg players, too much latency while playing.........It has ipx7 rating...but instruction manual says plz dont use near water...its a little confusing....Touch response is also good...and battery back is more than 4 hours..👍👍👍👍"
"I bought this product a couple months back, and did face a minor issue in connection. Well, I raised a complaint with the boAt team, and guess what, got an instant reply. The same day they picked my product, and told me they'll provide me with a replacement. Well, that was quick, but my replacement product arrived after literally a month and this time, they sent me a used and old product with a different color. The product was full of scratches and shabby looking. I did raise a complaint again, same response and they literally sent me back the same old used product. After that, they stopped replying to my mail and on call, they say they'll get in 48 hours, and they never have. I am utterly disappointed by the customer service they are offering. I even requested for the same product back, which I had initially raised complaint for, which as well is not going to come back. I have paid for a ""NEW"" product and now am using a old, shabby looking and used by someone else product. I regret my purchase. I will not suggest this brand if you are looking for a quality support for any defects and malfunctioning after you buy the product."
"After not even a month's usage, one of the earbuds has started showing signs of loose connection when put in the charging box. I have to manually adjust it so that it charges. Don't know although if its charging after I close the box.Sound is average, not great.Noise cancellation is good.The hinge of the charging box is also loose.Overall, this was my first wireless earphone, and truly speaking, experience is not very positive."
"It's a great product by Boat Industry in this price range. I am very choosy in my headphones. I have used many wired and Bluetooth devices. I too have Zabra lite, OnePlus Buds, but in comparison to the price range, it's unbeatable. The clarity and bass is excellent. It has also nice grips to hold with the ears. Does not seem to be painful for longer usage."
I liked the noise cancellation and sound quality of the product along with the grip which ensures that they don’t come off the ears. I bought these during an offer and found them worth the value. The touch is sensitive and you need to be careful while attending calls.
I really love this product by boat. ₹1799 for this product is value for money. Not such a high base lover so this airpods is best for me. No noise cancellation features but the design make you feel less noise from outside in short design of this earpod makes noise cancellation at his best. Sound quality is superb. Calling features is also good no problem in that. Problem occurs when you are away 5m from your phone. Overall i rate this product 4.5 at price of ₹1799 .It is highly recommendable to buy at this price if possible .
"I have buyed 2-3 TWS, but this one of the best i found, it's design is really good and product quality is also very good, some times minor connectivity issues comes, but we can easily solve by open and close the case or unpair and pair again, i have been using for more than 6 months, it's battery life is average, and bass is also average, but it's sound quality and noise cancellation is really good, it's good enough for gaming at this price range, better than other products"
"The volume needs to be on full, to get the good sound.  The fitting is good, wouldn't drop if running. Bass is less. But I didn't expect the volume level to be this low. You really have to put in full volume mode. The sound is clear when indoors, I haven't checked outdoors.The looks are good, the charger case is also good.I purchased the pro version as it IPX7 water resistant and has2600mAH carry case. Also the touch sensitive is very high, if you adjust the airdopes, the song gets paused. As of now I didn't find any noticeable lag while playing games.Overall for the price this is a steal.I paid only 1499 as I redeemed 1000 from my Amazon pay ICICI credit card.Further this review will be updated over it's uasge and results"
"I had bought the airdopes in July and immediately had a problem with the mic and had raised a complaint with boat customer service. They had asked me to ship it to a service center and after about a month I received an update that there is an issue and they will ship a replacement. Again after following up multiple times I received a used/repaired replacement which is still having bad mic issues. There is no original packing, cable, instruction manual etc. I received just the headphones in a small courier cover! Pic is attached. I have been trying to follow up with no luck with the customer service on why a new product replacement was not shipped and they are yet to respond for the last couple of weeks.The customer service is pathetic to say the least."
"I very much like this product.but some time conectivity will take time but batteriy back up to good ,sound quality is good,calling is to good but in noise place little bit disturd but it can overlook can possible.i suggest to all over all good product i used with my iphone is so nice combination i can’t explain.very good product and soild product."
I truly had a nightmare ish experience with this product im about to claim my warranty for a second time first time after only 3 months of use my right side ear set started lossing it's battery to quickly so I had to replace it but the new replacement product I recieved had huge connectivity issue and it kept on disconnecing when playing music i always experience an issue where one of the earset will decide not to connect it self and It had really annoyed me because I didn't experience this with my previous product so please from my experience I advise people to please don't buy this product it might be that I am the only unlucky one but who knows you might face the same issue so please consider before buying
"This is my first ever boat airdrop I have purchased, I must say that this is really value for money. The sound quality is really awesome even for those who are music geak with best in xlass noise cancellation. This is sure real paise vasool go for it"
Good quality ear phones. Have a compact carry and charging case that's stylish and easy to carry. Good battery life. Have used it nonstop for 8 hours straight.
"Sound quality: I have wired proton earphone as well. That was 700 rupees earphone and the sound quality was just amazing. Here, boAt airdropes is good in terms of sound quality but pales in terms of comparison.Call quality: Poor. The other person will feel like the phone is on speaker mode with all surrounding sounds.Noise cancelling: Well, it doesn't have active noise cancelling feature but I was okay with it as I couldn't hear any external sounds at 60% and above volume.Fit and build quality: This is where it is paisavasool. Perfectly fit and the earbuds won't fall off. Build quality is good too.Any issue:  Yes, sometimes the left ear bud stops responding which is too irritating. Then, you have to put it in case again and reconnect.Bass: Optimum.Treble: GoodTouch response: goodLagging: No lagging unless you are playing games.Auto off: It doesn't switch off automatically if you remove it from ears. You have to long press it or you have to put it in case to switch them off.Service: Not availed yet. So, I can't comment."
"I ordered airdopes about a month ago and found that my microphone will not work after about 30 min sometime after being on call. I need to recharge to get it to work again.I returned the product and got a replacement. The replacement has the same issue. I have tried multiple devices (phone as well as a laptop) and the microphone issue persists.I would exchange this for a regular Bluetooth headset any day. My other boat devices work like a charm, but this one turned out to be extremely disappointing."
"This buds good for listening music, not for talking on mobile.For listening Music 5 Stars (Good Sound Quality)For talking on Mobile 2 Stars (Too much back ground noise)Battery is good for 5-6hrs.Build quality above average (made in RPC!)Feels comfortable in ear, no problem with 3-4hrs of usageKept it for morning exercise routine listening."
"Better than the best. I use em everywhere. May it be gym, run, cycling of just listen to some nice music before dozing off. Build quality is good. The case is handy too unlike what it looks in the other pictures. Sound it just perfect. At this price range I feel these are the best one's out there."
"A big fan of Boat. Provides premiumness in budget pricing. Good TWS, but the drive makes a screaching noise at very low volumes. But if you increase the volume then you get a decent sound with proper base and trebble. Battery life is also good and the fit quality is average"
"As far as the sound is concerned, its fabulous, the bass is too good with crystal quality music. I would give a 4/5 on that. When it comes to fit it in the ear, its extremely inconvenient. Doesn't stay in the ear socket and keeps falling off, if you push it in the ear too hard, its gets too uncomfortable. The mic worked for couple of days and then it became garbled when spoken. Have ordered a replacement for it now as there was no option of return."
"Airdopes are ok sort of.For WhatsApp calls, these do not perform well.For normal calls, it is ok, however, the noice cancellation isn't there I would emphasize.Bass is good 👍🏻Those who want ok sort of performance may blindly go for these pods, look wise these are outstanding 👌🏻"
Worst quality product when u put that airdops in ur ear ur ears will be bloked and will start paining like anything not comfortable at all and when I requested for return Amazon refused to taken back worst service by Amazon
"It's a really good set of Ear buds considering the price it's going for. The promising bass is present and it's actually a lot in some cases so if you aren't a bass head then it isn't for you. The sound quality is astounding for the price Go for it , it's the best in the price range!"
"Overall experience with the headphone is good. Sound quality, battery backup and touch controls are awesome.The only problem which i faced Is the connectivity, when we try to connect the  headset with multiple devices. For proper connection and disconnections of the headset is happened only when i maintained with single device.Another problem which i faced is the whatsapp call.When u r on whats app call, at the time if you switch to some other app, then the person on the call wont hear your voice. But you can hear from the other person. Mobile : Oneplus 5T"
"Had pairing issues. They just wouldn’t pair. Factory reset was hard to perform and even after reset had pairing issues. Only the left ear bud was working even after multiple factory resets. So returned the item. And ordered a fresh pair.On receiving a fresh pair I noticed the packaging was different. There was a thin plastic wrapping all around the box. Also the tapes on the sides of the box had boat logo. None of this was there on the earlier box.So I suspect that the box was either tampered with, or it was a used piece or it was a fake boat product.The new pair of earbuds paired instantly. A detailed review on the fresh pair will be posted separately."
Sound/bass quality is excellent considering the price.Usability is pathetic. The capacitive  touch on the outer side is very sensitive when it doesn’t need to be; I accidentally hit it and pause my music/book/podcast so many times when I’m just trying to adjust them in my ear.And other times it’s completely unresponsive like when I’m trying to turn them off. I keep holding for 5-10 seconds and nothing happens.These would have been the best earphones in their price category had they simply been given buttons instead of this capacitive touch non-sense. They are beautiful sounding but very hard (almost impossible) to use.I ordered 2 of them and they both have the exact same sensitivity issue.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Pros: 1) good quality sound2) charging case is nice3) fast connectionCons:1) Drain out the battery, if want to use for entire day of office then you have to carry charging case and have to charge the airdopes again2) drops many times from ear, not very perfect fittings with ear3) due to point 2, I tried adjusting it while attending a call, it got disconnected - 3 times4) looks to be not very suitable for running or joggings.Suggestions:1).Can provide better holding mechanism to avoid falling from ear2) slightly.more space to be provided to adjust the eardopes without affecting the touch control area."
Product tends to get disconnected constantly while playing music n abruptly start again which is highly irritating. ...Returned first eardopes for same reason.Second exchanged item too hd same defect n also static noise in left earbud constantly. Fitting is slightly painful.However sound n bass quality n connectivity is good.But won't connect whatsapp calls.so I hv initiated for return.

"Do they at least test the product before marketing them? How can people be this irresponsible? I'm pretty sure no developer/tester or any one from boAt tested this product like a real user. Touch sensor is horrible. It's not designed to handle accidental touches. If they only tested this product with phone calls, they would have found it. Seriously man a whole company is irresponsible. This is a basic thing. I can't even adjust the buds when I'm on a call or listening to something. It disconnects the call suddenly (Because I ADJUSTED THE BUDS!!!). It's not easy to put it on without touching the sensor, they should have fixed that issue. Okay I can resist myself from adjusting it during calls, but if the buds are on the table, I can't even take them without touching the sensor, it connects the call before I'm ready. and the worst thing is, this happens only when I put the first bud, you know what happens if I take the second bud and put it on? It disconnects the call. BECAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY TOUCHED THE SENSOR....  Wow.... What a product, what a team and what a management. How did they even approve this product? I'm writing this review after using it for 1 hour. boAt team did not even test it for an hour. Completely unsatisfied. I have no other option but return it. Irresponsible team and irresponsible company.Design, Connectivity length, and audio quality are pretty good, but man, the touch sensors. Don't even think about having a good time with these stupidest stupid touch sensor earbuds."
"There is a serious dearth of good bluetooth earbuds. I have tried a few but have been dissatisfied each time.the top problems I have with this piece -1. Keeps Disconnecting2. 0 noise cancellation / horrible for recordings, mic quality is not that great3. Weird sensitivity- just a light touch is enough to disconnect a call  and sometimes longpress is not enough to restart4. Keeps falling offGood thing is1. I charging of  the case enables 3 time charge for the buds.2. the speaker ( what you hear )  sound quality is alright"
"Reviewing after 1 week of heavy use.Pros - 1. Great battery backup2. Sound average at this priceCons - 1. Sound feels bass boosted, makes it uncomfortable to wear it for more than 1 hour.2. Call quality - forget about it. This TWs is not known for good call quality.3. No app for music or touch customization like that of realme, not everyone has same music taste  so it is better to give the customer the carte blache to make it acc to their choiceConclusionIf you love bass this is it, it has so much enhanced bass inbuilt. I bought for 1700 in sale. If not in sale, it costs 2500.. for 2500 this is not upto the mark, go for others"
"Not worth it, I bought it for 2.5k. It has been 2 months since i bought it. It is only comfortable for large ears individuals, mine are medium so after wearing for sometime it starts hurting, it doesn't even fit properly in my ear.The sound in fine, or better than fine. The bass is thumpy, the trebles are also good.Their touch control even when touched to the wall or even the pillow when pressed hard.But after one month i accidentally dropped the left piece from waist hieght. Now the left one's sound is unbearable,(badluck). I still kept them using, ignoring the left one, but now i can't hear from the left piece. I used the warranty given and it will take 1 month for whole process.So its not worth the price paid.You can go for Boult audio propods (or name something like that). They have the same price."
"I have been using this product for the past couple of weeks and I have been noticing that the mic quality on these earbuds are absolute trash, if you are a person who would make a lot of calls , then these are clearly not for you, the audio quality is mediocre at best and another issue I’ve been noticing is that these won’t connect to your phone in an airport/airplane , people who should buy this are the ones who already have a premium pair and are looking to find extra ones to workout with as these are ipx sweat and water resistant and their gives a secure fit , that’s it , the last two lines are the only use for this product , these retail for 2500 for which it isn’t any worth ."
3rd class service given by boat imagine marketing. I give my airdopes back after 13 days of use they take my airdopes to the service center more than 1 and half months. I sent them mail regarding issue they didn't replied i m totally disappointed with the service of boat be care full while buying the product.
Really nice ear buds.. When hearing from Android device sounds are like heaven.. When using from iphone sounds usual head phone effect.. But not like ordinary headphones wired. This boat noise cancelation is really awesome and I have not expected like this.. Really superb.. Sound quality is awesome...
"Over all these are good but only for listening music and normal videos it has how do I say it surrounding sound effects and it's not good while watching shows while listening music can't tell much but problems is only when watching videos I'll be looking for some better onesEdit after first day use: it lags too much while playing and left one is making sounds like motor trying to start up its low but it's there can't use this my old boat neck band is working better than theseRatingSound: 3/5cuase in low volume sound quality drops too much cause mostly it's good for bass and surround sound and surrounded sound effect is permanentBass: 4/5bass is good this is the only thing going for these airdopsBattery life: 3/5Battery life is okk. at first it didn't last much long on first full charge it says 5 hours in airpods only. it lasted like 3.5 to 4 hoursBuild quality: 4/5build quality is goodNormal use 2/5I'm only adding this cause it's normal use I mean watching shows on it was fine in low volume or medium, sound quality drops to the the point I switched to my old boat neck bandsEdit after replacement: these replaced there very nice problems from before are somewhat present like lagging like my phone is in my pocket why do that and not gonna go on full length to rate these replaced ones cause all the rating given above I'll give it after use is  4/5 for over all product but because of bt connectivity problemill rate bt connectivity: 2/5 it works normally but unexpectedly always it laggs very bad and I tried in multiple devices same problem. to sound to bass to build quality it's good 😜"
Worst product ever and even worse service by boat. I ordered it on the releasing date and got it on 12th august but upon using for just two weeks it just stopped charging and it doesn't power on Or off by itself anymore. The pod doesn't work also. So my money is just wasted on the product as it just stopped working for no reason at all . I tried to contact boat company through many online website's also logged a complain but I haven't heard or got a reply from them since. Truly upset that I just wasted my money. Please don't buy from boat.
"I purchase this product for voice call but there is no use of it since I have purchase the device. The 2nd person couldn't here my voice although I got the replacement from boat but the service provided by boat is not good but one of the worst service I experienced.They take all my original brand new box with all accessories and Bluetooth device with my favorite color blue and replace it with only Bluetooth device with red color only with charging case not with box. They not give my accessories back so I am getting charging issue as I struggle to purchase another c type charging cable.But the most worst situation is that still I am not able to use the device which was replace with old used product have the same problem with my original device.The other person not able to receive my voice.Try to register a new complain again but there is no option to raised the complain again. Instead the Boat portal is throwing the local service center which is very far away from my address.Which is not possible to visit in the lockdown situation.Request all the viewer pls Don,t buy boat device as their service is very poor. Buy product from them is waste of money.I know this not always with everyone but as a customer we are one and united, please boycot the Boat product as much as possible. Although this also not cheaper but in order to raise my country level up for the growth of boat as Indian company I support it but Boat Don't think for their indian customer.Also request Amazon not to promote such type of company as in directly they are missguiding us and taking away our hard earned money.I was not in favor of this kind of review but I am forced to write thus because ignoring the issue is not a solution."
I had used the product for a long time and i personally suggest this budget airdops if you love music with bass.1. Battery backup is quit similar as mentioned by the company.2. Can hear bass at low volume too.3. Noise cancellation is average.4. Charging case quality is very good. I had dropped the case from 4 feet height and seems no damage.5. Bluetooth connectivity is superb.
Very nice airdopes by Boat. Gets connected easily with any type of mobile handset. Also range is approx 8-9 meters which is also quite sufficient. Quality of sound is also good. Good bass
The people who are searching for bass experiance..... This is one of the right choice for u to choose..... Sound quality is awesomeAnd  the bass is very gud and smooth with classic sound..... Noice cancellation is perfect.... Battery is quite wellCall quality is gud and the battery performance is comaparitivey less time for calls than music
"Unexpectedly good sound quality.......great battery backup.....and great build quality.......Pairing is fast......and the waterproofing really works, i have been in rain wearing them, no issues there......Also for the call quality.....dont go with the reviews....call quality is good....Just go ahead and buy them.....you will be amazed by their performance"
"Quality of this earphones is good, sound quality and controls are good but one thing is you may face some difficulty in your ears if you put it in your ears for long time like more than one hour. Also talking on calls is really good no issue with that."
Amazing ear dopes. Sound quality and clarity is amazing. Charging station also works fine and most of all very easy to travel with saves alot of space and is just perfect. For me the ear-dopes fit perfectly and i can use them for long hour. Really happy
Simply too good...I already bought a Boat airdopes 441 Pro during Amazon Prime day and was quite happy with my buy...The next day I ordered a  Boat airdopes 441. I was happily shocked to see it. It was a much more smaller box than the 441 Pro...I wonder how they managed to put 400 mAh into it...Anyway I hope both last me a year or two...I have other Boat products with which I am very happy till date
"Amazing pair of buds for the price. It's unbeatable. If you love bass, this one's got you covered 100%.My new favourite pair. No complaints so far. Delivery was quick, packaging was great, no dents, scratches, rips... Nothing. Extremely satisfied. I'd definitely recommend this pair."
Great ear dopes .with one draw back ie on calls the mic is not able to capture sound and the listener has to struggle to hear you. Didnt expect this flaw with boat dopes
Bad: Bass is ok but shallow. You won't get the punchy feeling (comparing it with Sony MDR xb50). The bass makes mid tone wash off which is really annoying. You actually lose quality because of this.Good: good battery life and connectivity. Case is big but with that battery power you are good to go for a long time without charging.
Bought this product little over a month ago as an anniversary gift for my husband. He just tried it today and the battery gave up in 2 hours even with full charge AND the sound kept going in and out.We called Amazon and they denied from returning. This is the first time Amazon has let me down.I would strongly recommend against buying this product. It was a waste of money for me and my husband wasn’t very happy about this product or service.
So sound quality and bass are all okay okay (doable) but what really strikes me off is it's useless if you are a Mac user. It totally ruined my experience as my most of the time spent in front of my working station but it's useless and keeps disconnecting as soon as I try to connect them. And now I can't even Return them (there's only replacement option😫).So all my money is wasted on this useless air dopes....really super bad experience and it's my first day and I am writing this review. Thanks to Boat and Amazon for this experience
"No Complain The Product Is Awesome But Not Worth of 1999 , buy this when it's on sale or something it will be sold like 1399 or lower1. The Bass Is too much on this earbuds some of you may like it or some aren't gonna like it  , For Me It's an neutral reactionBuy this earphone only if you love Bassy type of music2. The colour are actually vibrant in real life also they steal the show for everyone's eye there colour choices are awesome specially the red and black , The Colour Combo Became My Favourite After Seeing The Looks Of It 🌝🌚3. Will Further more Update this Review After Some Months , Hopefully My boAt Stays Ok  Till Then ☺️"
I was using Boat Rockers 255 for long time and have a lot of commuting on two wheeler due to my work profile.They were the best thing in my life. Each year December I would get 1 new pair and give away the old pair to my office staff members. This year sadly right ear piece sotopped working. So I decided to upgrade from 255 to 441 true wireless. Have used them for not more than 6 hrs... In which I got 6 to 7 calls during commute. Each person had only one response.... Please remove the Bluetooth and talk over the phone.... So.... I had to stop on the side of the road each time to be able to talk to my clients/family/friends.... Which clearly looses the first point of using a Bluetooth on the go.P.S I ordered 1st pair on Prime day sale day 1. & In 2 hrs approximately the price of the Bluetooth decreased from 2499 to 1999.... Which is a staggering 500 INR. So I cancelled the order and purchased again in the new deal.So all in all I would suggest please buy if you have a personal Car or a closed cabin office to talk to people else the recipient of the call will just be irritated
"A great product from boat....amazing sound and bass...however bass is not very punchy, its more on a linear side but its good enough for me....battery life is amazing....i charge it in two to three days and i use it almost 8-9 hours a day....build quality is good, premium in hand feel, noise cancellation is decent, fits in the ear perfectly and you can easily wear it for long durations....overall totally satisfied with the product...😇😇"
Very easy to setup and start using. Didnt check on noise cancellation but once we wear this earbuds(rubber plugs) outside noise is arrested completely. Good for attending meetings and hearing songs.
Review based on owner .Owner likes it . Owner doesn't expect noise cancellation.. But good ..Since this tws doesn't have it . good sound as reported by owner.
"Sound Quality was good and Bass was very good, using it for music, movies and calls. One small draw back is during calls you need to speak louder on Airdopes compared to regular phone. I’m able to use it for both laptop and mobile, connectivity is easy and fast. Initially had issues with volume after doing factory reset couple of times it’s working perfectly brought it on launch day till now charged the case only once very good battery backup."
"The airbuds are nice. Best feature is battery backup of the case and mono use. Connection to phone is pretty fast. Just take some time to get used to touch functionality. Not the best when it comes to voice call, the listener keep complaining of low sound specially when you are outside, but i found if you hold the right bud as a microphone near your mouth, it solves that problem."
Within a month my one earbud piece stopped working.Update 1- As per given on warranty card I filled details and registered complaint on 23/10/2021.(Wait for next update as users complaint that warranty is not given or service is not proper)
"These eardopes are only for listening to quality music. It blocks literally all other sound. U can't hear the call bell, the horn from behind, nothing. If u are on a call using these eardopes, u r screwed. Even the neighbor will hear ur voice but not whom u r talking to. Worst equipment for voice/video call. On the other hand, best for music."
This review is after decent use of more than 40 days..The earbuds are having following pros n consPros1) Good sound quality2) Good power backup (case backup good)3) can pair one at a time also4) super fast auto pair on opening buds case5) touch instead of buttons6) fits in ears wellCons1) poor Noise cancellation2) the buds are smooth n slips from fingers sometime while plugging in/out3) auto touch click sometimes while adjustingOverall good buds....Recommended for music n gaming...Not recommended for call use....very poor noise cancellation....
"The sound quality of the product is good, the bass quality is also decent and the overall performance is quite satisfactory.  The noise cancellation of this product is below average because the person on the other end would listen all the background noises very clearly rather than your voice.Before Buying read it very carefully, the Service is really Pathetic! You would be cheated for sure, this is because this is the 2nd time am facing the issue with BOAT company. For this product, first within a few months it stopped connecting to my devices, when I raised a complaint for warranty repair, they sent me a different Color Airdopes with a lot of scratches and especially a used one. Originally I was having a red Airdopes 441 but after warranty replacement they sent me a black one with used and scratched condition. Infact, it also have some sound problems. Now they have stopped entertaining my issues, even if I raise a complaint, they ignore it. Also worst customer care ever, as the person sitting on the other end has only one job, that is to escalate the ticket, that’s it. So as I said, it’s happening for the second time with me, my personal experience with BOAT company is really bad. Buy BOAT products and just hope it stays well throughout or else you would be in this useless customer service trap."
When u dont play the music or a muted scene in use they make hissing sound which is sometimes uncomfortableNoise cancellation is not bad but active noise cancellation is not up to the mark as compared to Boat products. Could have been little betterBass is nice for 6mm driverBest advantage of the pro model is 2450 mah case which can be used as an emergency power bank it has support for usb port which can be used to charge your mobile.Can be used to play games as well no latency the sound is very goodGood product if u are thinking to buy a neckband well u can give this a try as well. Amazon has 10-30 days replacement scheme so you can try compare and return which ever suites you. My personal choice would be this because of the battery backup.
"I'm really happy with my purchase. For this rate, I've had a great experience with the dopes. Battery lasts. Music quality is really good. Problem arises if you're talking to someone when on a call, it picks up ambient noise over your own voice, so can't use for calls especially if you're out somewhere. Also after a year, the left dope stopped working as well. I mean the voice is louder on the right one. So overall I'm happy because for 2k I got these to last an entire year, having used it everyday!"
"Got this delivered on 9th Nov 2020. Using daily for an 3 hours. I charged the entire set (Charging case + Earbuds) on 9th Nov and still haven’t charged. Using it for almost 12 days and still I can use it for another 3 days without charging. Once the earbuds are charged. It plays for almost 3 to 3.5 hrs and then you need to charge. One draw back I would say that u can use it for long time as you ears will start paining. Overall good product.Also, you can use the case as mini power bank in case you are shortage with electricity supply"
Amazing product. Everything was as stated in the description. The sound quality is bomb. The battery backup is superb. It looks stylish as well. You can order this without any hesitation. Not that heavy and easy to wear. An amazing deal to grab for sure.
Four things to consider1. There is no noise cancellation - Surrounding sounds are clearly audible than our voice.2. The touch button is very sensitive - can be easily mistouched.3. No clear audible sound when you are getting a call. - needs to be checked at mobile if we are getting any call.4. No information when airdopes battery is finished - rightaway it will switch off without any prior information.Other things battery and sound quality is good.
"Got them for special offer at 2k and really appreciate the sound quality in such an affordable price.If you are looking for ear buds with total value for money , wait for the offer and then order.Very less latency and bass quality is superb.Trebles are fine and touch is super sensitive.Go for it!!"
"Delivered on 10,and today is 18.i haven't charged it from past 1week, still its showing 2points of battery remaining. I was using it for almost 3 hrs minimum a day. Bass is OK OK. Connectivity is too quick. Calls are clear and audible. Bluetooth range is also good. No loss of connection untill 10m range(i tried moving into next room, nd can still hold the connection). Case is small and compact than what I expected and I like it. At first had a issue in connecting it with mobile. It takes tym to understand how to connect, but once it's connected, then it's a cake walk. Got it fr 2500 and pretty happy with it. No static noise on left bud or either buds as some mentioned earlier."
"Review Updates: See upto last.I was very confused before buying this. I have researched like Mad. I wanted to final Boult True Bass TWS eadpods as it has very good performance. I was hesitating before buying this Boat Airdopes 441 as It has both positive and negative reviews here. Some are saying it is good while others are saying this is very bad. But I finally dare to buy this. I was very worried about mic performance but at indoor mic quality is good. Faced no problem with mic at indoor but haven't tried it at outdoors. Bass quality is good too.. overall v.good sound quality. But I have Expected More from it. I thought I will get Totally different experience than wired earphones but I must say I was wrong. My Realme buds 2 (Rs 599) is equally good or better I would say..I just hope it don't get worse after use. It is so delicate to use. And I am always in fear that one bud either right or left will stop working some day in day to day use. The case is small, funky, sexy and delicate so be careful.I am using it from 2 days And I just Hope It will last long for years and I don't have to claim warranty inbetween as I don't want this airdopes to stop working like here people say in their review.I will update my review after a month of using it. Let's just hope It works well and I hope I don't get any problems here otherwise it will waste of Rs 2000. Fingers crossed🤞🏻. For now I would say yes Go for it👍🏻Update:After 3 days of use: Battery backup seems just ok. 10% battery down in just 15 mins of music. Each our 20-30% battery drain seems battery is not that promising as advertised like 5hrs on single charge. Now facing bad call quality indoors too. If I speak normal or loudly it is audible to other side. Slightly lower voice or regular sound isn't audible on other side during call. Battery backup poor."
Excellent Airpod in this price Range.Sound quality is awsomeBattery backup is BetterBass is excellentEasy to connectTouch is smooth and sensitiveLight weightClear voice during callingA must buy in this price Range
Worst product . it's right ear bud stop functioning with in the 2 months of purchase.Call centre no. Is switched off and nobody responding on mail.Will never buy and recommend this product to anyone.Thats why foreign companies getting succeed because they care about their customers
I used this one for last 3 weeks . After using for 3 weeks i should tell you the right review of this product Boat 441 -1) Bass - very good but not perfect . I give 4.7 out of 5 .2) Sound Quality - according to price range sound is good . I give 3.8 out of 5 .3) Call Quality - indoor its perfect but when u ride a bike or u go outside there is lot of disturbance .4) Battery life - when u use regular its battery life is only 3.5 hours per earbuds but when u use normal its give u around 4-5 hours backup .At last according to price range its a good product by Boat . I give 4 out of 5 Thanks to everyone or Thanks to Amazon .
"i bought it for my relatives after i bought.... its makes our lockdown full of entertainment by streaming online action movies with great basss. but for calls it wasn't that great lack of good noise cancelation, but sound quality is good"
"I bought this on Feb 12 and replaced with another as right piece was not working, on receiving replaced product both didn't workNow I doubt I received fake products back to backOn left is the product I received1.BoxOn Left, is recent one with red, seems like fakeOn Right, bought by known person few month ago2. Bottom of the case looks different3. Charging contacts Has 2 on left which is fake Has 3 on right which works fine"
It’s been almost a year now since i bought this. It’s fine in the beginning. You get decent sound quality but as the time progresses issues arises especially with the left side. The volume from left is hardly noticeable. It happened multiple times throughout the year. It gets fixed on its own and then back. The battery backup is around 1.5hrs when maxed then it needs to charge. Now the buds slips out of my ear and also started to hurt while using. Not a good wholesome experience with these earphones.
the sound quality is better than most brands in this budget....the charging case has a very long battery life as told on box....but treble side of the sound is a bit weak not so much that can be problematic to any one..still a very nice pair of buds and has a really good fitment and has a really comfortable inear experience...in the end its a product u can look forward to buy.
"The product worked well for about a month but started to stutter with low audio output on left airdope. On reporting the issue and sending the product back under warranty received a replacement. Unfortunately, that too is showing the same issue after 2 months of use.Feel cheated. On top it, now the support portal is not allowing registering a pick up and is expecting to travel to another nearby city to get warranty service. Customer service number landing on IVR system. In short, politely but firmly closing doors on any customer support. Would highly recommend not to waste money on this product."
1 Month review-Sound Quality is decent but don't compare with the likes of sennheiser.-Good for casual usage but won't recommend if you use earphones all day.Things I didn't like or needs improvement------------------------Normal Pairing issue + No support for multiple device which is annoying-Range is also an issue.Distortions observed when you leave the room although distance was not the much-Call audio issue in noisy backgrounds(You will need to speak loudly)-Also Echoes observed during some of my calls.
"Here is my Six months usage reviewPros-Sound quality is goodBass quality is goodNoise cancellation works fineCons-Battery backup  of ear buds is around two and half hours in one charge cycle against claims of 5 hours.Mic quality is really poor,i won't advice you to use the ear buds for calling purpose.Ear buds size is too large for the ears,soo it feels really uncomfortable after continuous usage of half an hour."
"Everything is good but connectivity is very poor. So I replaced old...But again in new product I'm facing play/pause, backward/forward issue...Plz don't go for it... Within 3 to 4 months these much prblm... Extremely dissatisfied...Very poor production from boat..."
Sound Quality is Very Good at this price range... If I compare sound quality with a popular wired headphones than it sounds better than Realme Buds 2...Bass is little bit better than Realme Buds 2...But not like Sennheiser CX 180...Mids and Highs are also good...Noise Cancellation is Good... Battery Performance could have been batter...overall value for money product.
"Bad quality of sound. No whatsapp calls. High echo bouncy sound don't waste money at all. Don't be surprised to see the offer price, its just expensive then its normal online price. Don't keep your eye on offers.Disappointed! Thats why people don't trust indian companies. Very few companies who keeps promise of quality.Bad bad badest!"
"No need to write review for boat, simply we can buy,But highlights are1.battery life - excellent2.bass- excellent3.fit on ear- very comfortable, but initial days you will feel little bit pain4.listening experience- you will feel like you are in theatreDraw backs- need to adjust volume on mobile"
"Sound quality is pretty good but I'm not a basshead and so I had to fiddle through my EQ to adjust that migraine-inducing throb that came with the Airdope's overdone bass. Noise cancellation doesn't really deserve a mention. It feels like you've got a pair of rubber tip buds in your ear. That's about it. The mics are too sensitive to the point of being almost unusable for a lot of calls unless you're in a windowless room and nowhere near a spinning fan. The touch sensitive buttons are overly sensitive and the response is extremely delayed to the point of annoyance. I'd tap the button and wait for a good whole second to know whether my music is about to be paused or not. Also, the bluetooth range is a joke once you leave the room without your phone.Fortunately, I didn't expect a lot from 2000 rupee earphones. I just needed a pair of buds that would give me some ambient music when I'm on the move and wouldn't fall out of my ears easily. The Airdopes 441 obtains passing marks for the ambient music once I fixed the EQ. And it obtains 5/5 for a snug fit. No matter what I did, the buds refused to fall out of my ears despite some rigorous and unrealistic conditions.OverallAudio: 2/5Mic: 1/5Connectivity: 2/5Interface: 1/5Fit: 5/5Design 4/5"
"2nd day it was hanging a bit , was about to return but after resetting it worked , so did not return .Few days later (after return period was over), the left earpod is not working. Feels like refurbished/malfunctioning product was delivered.Highly disappointed as I gifted it.Am upset that they have to visit the service center for the gift they received.Please work on testing the product and then release it to the market .The sound quality was good."
"For the truth guys, this is fantastic, people who are confused about ipx to rating i tell them this is IPX7, and when i saw ratings about it's sounds and bass quality in youtube, i really dont understand when they say bass is not upto the mark, this is a fantastic bass products i really liked it, thanks a lot amazon, the only problem i get for the first time when i make a call it gets disconnected sometimes i might not be able to hold in my ears properly, and becz its touch sensitive is very high.. overall when i used to it this is fantastic.. i received it for rs1949. Thanks a lot amazon"
"Decent pair of Bluetooth earphones at this price point. But there is pretty much no noise cancellation at all. Also it has connectivity issues with an iPhone, it has a mind of it's own, it will connect when it wants to and automatically disconnect when it wants to."
"Pros- better secure fit even in helmet- best battery life haven't charge the box for last  30 days and earbuds also last for 3.5 to 4hrs  even at high use-little extra bassCons- Very high latency ( lag time high) readily  noticeable while answering calls- No volume control- Sound quality just ok- Large box- do not get directly fit in box , sometimes I  worry that it may get short circuit- Noise cancellation is is just ok not good- Not classy product lights up ocassionally and  everytime there is  callVerdict - good for travellers and office peoples"
"Best budget earpods. (after 2 months use)Battery backup - 4.5/5 starsSound quality - 4/5 starsComfort - 3.5/5 stars(can't wear em for more than 3 hours, but OK)Bass - 4.5/5 starsConnectivity - 5 starsBuild quality - 5 starsWater proof - 5 starsLooks a little big in the ear 👂🏼 not that big.Overall 4.5 stars ✨"
"The product is amazing....Below are the point covering good and bad points of the product after use of 2 month.Positive:-1. Amazing Bass.2. Instant connectivity to the paired device.3. Good battry life.4. Charging case is also good and charges the headphone in a less time.5. Noice reduction works amazing. Like 75% of the noise is reducsed. As used this headphone outside the recidency.6. Fitting of the headphone is amaing is use while cycling too. Also dont have fear of loosing them. As its stuck so well in the ears.Negative: -1. After using this headphone more than 30 min, ears start painning badly due to the rubber grips.This review is given after 2 month of use. It your have big ears then go for it as the battery life is amaing."
"The sound quality of these TWS is really impressive and bass is just perfect.For connectivity there is IWP (Instant wake and pair technology) in it, which connects the TWS to your Mobile very quickly.And it also has Fast pair technology (by google) too.The CTC (Capacitive touch control) works properly, there is not much delay in response.I think if you want to buy a TWS in budget segment, then this is the best TWS for you.The only con that I found in these TWS is that you can not control the volume of the bluetooth device by the touch control, you have to reach your smartphone and then you can control it from volume button of your phone.This is a 5 star product in my opinion. Go for it👍🏻⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Mic doesn't work with MacBook Catalina OS Version 10.15.2 (19C57), mic keeps disconnecting once connected.Other party couldn't hear me so I opened system preferences -> sound. unfortunately on mic test option, the system hangs and disconnects earphones. Now if the problem is with earbuds or MacOS or bluetooth versioning, I am not sure.Works fine on my iPad and iPhone, be careful . I will update the review if there is any change, so far it hasn't worked even after trying for hours."
"1. The earbuds looks great, everybody going for the red colour variant, but believe me the yellow colour variant is the best.2. Ear buds fits in the ears well and quite light weight.3. Noise cancellation is good.4. Audio quality is good, bass is too heavy.5. Bluetooth connectivity is great.6. Touch controls are great too, very responsive.7. Battery backup is pretty decent.8. The only cons is if you are using it for 3-4hrs you feel some pain in the ears.I bought this for only 1999rs. in Amazon sale ,so I'm very satisfied with my purchase, great deal for me."
Connectivity is very goodU open box and its connects with device in no timeMusic is goodOptimum bass (extra bass causes earproblem in log duration and are discomfortable )U can wear this for hours without any trouble4 hr musicsI do 20 minutes skipping daily and found no problem in ear fit (this may vary person to person)
The day it came we were mind blown. But the the day return window closed the left earphone stopped working. Now Amazon says contact manufacturers. How do they think we will get through. It's not even fifteen days we bought the product. But it sucks... Now 2200 rs are wasted. Don't buy guys.
I have tried many airdopes but finally I have choosen this one because of battery life.So i have ordered two.And here is my review after 3 days.🔋 5/5Base 4/5Sound 4/5( not very clear on call)Mic 2/5( I thinkI have a defective mic on right side bcoz its not working)Charging 5/5Few more points1. Look wise very good2. Comfort adjustments3. Touch is very good4. battery life is goodCons1. 3pins are given but in case only 2 are available.2. Sometimes issue with touch it accidentally touches a lot.3. Shows 5 hrs but only gives 3.5 hrs music time
"I just love this airdopes 441, you get a kind of  noise cancellation without any noise cancellation feature you just have to select the perfet earbud tip size for yourself and its a game of vaccum. At almost 50 to 60% volume they sound great u can increase it according to you… some might face a problem while using it for the first time those who just changed to wireless buds from wired earphone as i said u just have to choose proper size of earbud tip and that ear wings/flag. As mentioned by some YouTube review while whatsapp calling or any internet calling you can hear the person you are talking to but your voice slightly reaches him/her in low volume, on normal call it sounds normal as you are talking on your mobile it self after all its wireless. The design is great it fits properly after using proper siz budtip , i loved those rgb lights , the touch response is a very little bit slow almost half sec delay u can feel when u pause or play a song. Other than that this are very good tws earbuds. If you want great sound quality , great Bass quality you can blindly go for this ones ."
"10/09/2021Wooow... super Built Quality,,  The buds are very nice and perfect Caught and adjust in the ears. There is no fear of getting out of the ear easily. The intensity of the sound is as it should be.and... Calling experience in home is good and When you are on Road or on bike the person in front of you has to speak a little louder to get your voice and he get noise...12/09/2021I'm having a bit of a problem, the device just disconnects while talking on the phone, so I'm sending for a replacement15/09/2021Today I got my device replaced and the problem was solved.Thanks Amazon..  Thanks BoAt..."
Guys It gives a premium lookAnd sound quality is amazingCaptive touch is also very sensitiveIWP technology is really worksBass is amazing 💕😍Battery backup is also goodAs compare to price boat Airdops 411 is best in class and it gives that every in 2500It is best 👍💯 as compare to Realme and JBL C100 TWS because they don't have any water and sweet ratings.
Bought this product for just 1599 from Amazon in offer periodGreat product...loved it's fast connectivityGreat fit with the big shark fin... excellent noise cancellation when you use it with the large shark fin... excellent call quality...clear vocals while playing songs as well as on call... excellent voice quality feedback received from the other side on callLoved the product... totally satisfied 😍
"If you're looking for some home theater effect then this one is not the right for you besides it is a good product for gym workouts especially running. However, for music lovers who'd appreciate a cleanse music and feel the beat/ray of every audio line then this product lacks in delivering such.choice is yours."
"The box i received was previously opened. The sealed sticker was removed and normal tape was put in place.Accessories like extra eartips were missing.Apart from that, the tap button on the airdopes is actually a bad design. Just a minor brush of your hand while adjusting the piece in your ear will disconnect a call, or pause a track."
"I'm writing this review after 5 months of usage. The sound quality, bass, battery backup are good👍👍👍. But the airdopes are slippery and some times falls out of ears even with the ear wings.After 4 months of usage one of the airdopes started making noises🔊🔊🔊 that are constant like a radio signal. I have applied for warranty service 2 times and both times I recieved a defective product which makes the same noise and one airdope button was not working🔇🔇🔇. They won't give a new product they only sent you a used product.I'm not recommending boat company because of the worst warranty service the 1 year warranty is useless 👎👎👎"
"After searching multiple earbuds, I found this one. Even when you put these without music, I hardly can hear anything from the surrounding which is great. The earbuds are great with bass and overall quality and volume. Being a music lover at the gym , I keep the volume at 80% and it's amazing. The best earbuds within this budget. If you're worried about the trebles because of the bass, i felt the trebles are great. 😍"
The looks and feel of the device is very good. CASE is heavy and looks classy. Pairing and connectivity is good and sound is clear and loud for user. Bass and thump is better than most of the TWS in this price range. It automatically conects to your device once you open the top lid of the case. Noise cancellation is Neither good nor bad.I was using it on 75% volume for most of the time and its hold on charge for around 4hrs 45 minutes. Not bad for such a small device.Design- 4/5Quality- 5/5Sound- 4.5/5Bass- 4/5Charge & Connectivity- 4.7/5Noise canceling- 4/5If you are planning to buy a TWS go for boat 441. I loved it and you'll too.
"Definitely Woooow product 😍.. just go for it without any doubt.. previously I used ptron and other earbuds , comparing to all boat airdopes 441is really a very very good products & I'm using them from 3days and bass is rocking and Battery performance is absolutely stunning with 500mAH. Hattts off to boAt.. 👌"
"The initial experience was good. Thought its a value for cost, however, two weeks, in the pods are completely useless for use in calls. When calling on whatsapp, the bluetooth would drop often. Tried with other bluetooth headphoens and earphones and all worked well, but these pods never made it until the end of the call. Has good charging , but whats the point, never got to recharge and stopped using these pods. After a week, i trashed the packaging, and now i am repenting. Cant return, waste of money and a bad experience with boAt as a brand."
"Writing review after using for 6 months.At first it was really good with sound quality but after 5 months problem started with mic, battery and charging. Currently my battery back up is 1-1 hr 30 mins, can’t use on mono mic won’t work properly, while in box the EarPods will get connected if you haven’t kept Bluetooth off. Bass I bad as well. I was not expecting this from boat and won’t recommend to buy."
I'm using this product from 8-9 months now and the touch sensor for one of the earpods has stopped working. Battery backup has dropped down to maximum 2 hours after full charge. It doesn't charge over 80%. These things were not expected from a premium Boat product. I'll refrain buying it from now.
"First of all, the main concern for me is the Sound Quality. I am a DJ, always prefer to play & listen natural & neutral sounds. But i found a little bit more bass in these earbuds which is unnatural that make me use EQ with bass reducer feature for balancing sounds. Rest High & mid is accurate & clear to me. Good for them who love artificially extra bass.Battery backup is good as company claim upto 5 hours.Found smaller Fin is more comfortable which comes with the Earbuds in the box."
"I've been a JBL user for a long time. For the first time I'm using boat and I'm okay with it. The sound quality doesn't match JBL since this is my first TWS, it might take time to get accustomed to it. Nevertheless, great delivery by amazon as always. Build quality is good and Connectivity also. Bass is too much to my liking and low and mid-range sound is good. Battery backup is good. It lasted for around 6 hours in 50 range."
Do not buy airdrops like this. It often fells from ear. I used the minimum sizes but it keeps on falling from my ears. Also my entire ear is close while using it. Bcz of this it got repaired in 6 months. So I have reached customer service and got replacement. Only good thing is they are providing good customer service.  Please make sure you have big ears before buying airdrops
the boat airdopes 441 sound and bass quality is very nicebut the major problem is its battery life even when I listen the music at 60% volume the battery performance is getting down within 2.5 hours but they mentioned the battery life as 5 hours on single chargeanother problem is the charging case whenever I put airdopes on charging case its only charging upto 90% and not charging fully to 100% whenever I open the case even after one day its always showing only green light but no blue light on the airdopes
Just Go for it.1- Deep Bass2-Clear Crystal Sound3-5hr Plus Play time5-No pain in ear while continuous Using6- Awesome Bluetooth ConnectivityNo _Cons ...How people gave Negative  comment
"The quality of sounds is very neat. It's comfortable and sleek.The issues I've faced are that it keeps getting disconnected from my phone while watching something. Sometimes it happens multiple times in a short span of time.It happens at least once a day.Another problem i face is that everytime i put it back in its case, one of the earpods doesnt sit correctly in its charging slot, so i have to adjust it every time i put it.I'm happy with the sound quality, and disappointed that there are such very basic problems in an otherwise beautiful product."
I used right earbud single and the battery is 80% after 30 min it showing 30% battery and after one hour its zero then i put it into the case to charge and start left earbud using another day the battery of right after 24 hours only 60 %charged in 24 hours.. and next day i used it only 2 hours and the battery goes zero.. bont buy if you have long usage.. sound and bass is very good but battery is worst... When you r riding then you cant talk bcoz mic is in front of earbud so sound is very bad wen driving on bike.. and when you use google assistant and google make wrong dial the call will not cut whatever times you touch the ctc..
"Hi Team,I have been using the boat airdopes for the past 15 days and have been facing constant issues.1. At regular intervals sometimes either the right or the left airdope stops functioning. No sound is heard during this time.2. During team meetings my voice is not audible to the other team member. I have to shout in order to make myself audible.I have been a loyal customer of boat for the past 2-3 years and have always been an advocate of its premium quality. I am disappointed with this product. I would like the team to arrange for product replacement or refund whichever is convenient for the team."
Just unpacked and tried it - easy pairing with phone & Laptop. Excellent quality - ease of use - good touch response.Need to see the Battery backup.. Overall 4.5/5 rating.

 It’s a amazing product and also value of money at this priceI am using almost all products of BoatBluetooth catching power also very high comparing to otherBass of this ear piece can’t explainCharge also lastedEar fitting also good , if we shake head also it don’t come out.Delivery speed also goodI am really satisfied with this Boat Airpode 441"
There are many earbuds in thia price segment my reason for buying these ones was the IP67 rational. For the price these are really good. Bass is nice and they are loud you won't hear anything while listening. Call quality is also good and mic are also crystal clear.
Purchased this product in 3rd week of February 2021. Within approx 3 months the sound quality deteriorated so much that it was equivalent to Local fake Boat product & within 6month right side EarPod emits volume as if it’s almost muted (On scale of 1 to 10 with maximum volume the sound is somewhere 0-1) making one feels that he/she is probably deaf from right ear. On top of that none bothered to repair or replace even after numerous complaints. Sorry that I bought Boat product from Amazon. It seems like Amazon has been selling all cheap & fake versions of electronic products at MRP.

 Awesome Product for listening music.Bass is superb quality and Noise canceletion is nice.Ear tips are good fitted fitted and nice un boxing package.Tested by - laxmilal Creator/Dj Mms Pro"
"I like this product very much. I use this for about 6-8 hours a day and it last for approx. 4 days. Thumbs up for battery life. I like to highlight the bass, people who like bass should not think twice before buying this product. I give treble 8.5 and highs and mids 9Actually compared with apple airpods pro 😅Ofcourse there is difference but not muchI feel airdopes noise passive cancellation better than airpods pro active noise cancellation.For the 10th of price this airdopes are problem for airpods pro and for other budget tws🤣 .I would definately eecomment this to everyone except for gaming purpose.The only problem in this is that hizz sound sometimes and my right earbud heat up"
Pros: Fast ChargingGood bassGood for listening from apps like Youtube and SaavnCons: Call Quality is not so good. Its blurryTreble is not good. Hard bass.Slippery from Ears if not used the right ear gripperSensitive touchNot easy to take it out of ear
"Bass quality worth it but after using for abt 2 months, left one is not working well, it sounds low a lot compared to the right one, I'm not getting where should I show them for service centre in nashik, they was working well when I bought them but After using for half and month they started giving me problems in sound and bass in left airdope, make sure you buy it if a service centre is nearby to you and overall quality is good but make sure about the service centre amd check before you start using it on high volume. Don't know a company loke Boat is doing that bad after it's just 1.5 months I bought and problem started in left, I'll not recommend to anyone else."
"Honestly it's not useful because it's not fit properly in ear.I don't like at all, it's neither have bass nor anc.I got the product in which touch was not working. I saw number of reviews and purchase but that all are not worthy at all."
"purchased it a week ago @1800 rupees,for the price i would say these are the best pair of earphones i have ever used. i also have boat wireless 450 headphones and comparing them i liked these airdopes more. however using them for more than an hour can cause pain in the ear due to earfangs. but altogether they are nice. touch sensitivity is also up to the mark. bass is incredible and fairly good mids and lows. if your bugdet is under 2k these are the best u can get ....❤️❤️"
"1st product i received was defective,The replacement product i got was working properly but had some major scratches on case.I can clearly say it is refurbished product.Do not buy boat because it is low price product go for samsung earbuds they are way better Currently i m using it."
One ear won't work half the time. Works horribly with my MacBook. Sound quality is bad. You'll have to really turn up the volume to have an experience.Please don't waste your time with this.
"Transmission of music data at rates faster than the speed of light seemed convenient, until I realized I was hearing the music before I actually wanted to play it. Apparently Boat forgot how accustomed most of us are to unidirectional time and the general laws of physics. I tried to get used to this effect but hearing songs play before I even realized I was in the mood for them just really screwed up my preconceptions of choice and free will. I'm still having a major existential hangover.Would not purchase again."
"It is a good product for a Bluetooth earphone . It fits great on my ears doesn't fall while running, jumping or doing other such activities which involves a lot of movements. It connects nicely but causes problems when there is other device in the room which has been previously connected to it.i have been using it for weeks now it is giving me issues with connection alot if if there is no other device around it disconnects itself and it does that alot lately but when its connected it has a good sound quality"
"The sound quality, fit, connection and battery of the airdopes is good. But, the battery of the case seems to get over fast, like in 10 hours rather than 30. The indication on the case also doesn't work accurately. Got the whole case and earphones replaced under warranty, it works like a charm. Battery total gives around 30 hours. Best true wireless earphones."
"Good,battery life of earpod is 1 to 1.5 hrs,but of case is 5-6 days.quality of sound and bass is good.cons is the case covering which gets scratches ealisly just by keeping in pocket also due to poor matt finish.rest is good and can be purachsed."
"After using this product a week, am writing this review. Product durability is good but noise cancellation feature is not working as expected. while talking over the calls it keep disconnecting and there is lots of noise, when tested with other ear buds there is no noise. I might got faulty product if it is working good for others. How ever my recommendation is go for branded product always (though bit expensive). over all it is not good."
First or fall a bad delivery by AmazonNow coming to the product I had read so many reviews about the this one before buying and sawed many review videos in youtube and asked many others I got to see that  many members told that it has exaurstion after going to 70 or 80 %volume but there is no exaurstion even when at 100% volume we can get good bass and sound very nice productSound=5 ratingBass=5 ratingNoise cancellation=5 ratingEverything five sometimes it becomes like Dolby Atmos from left bud to right bud the sound travels it will be amazingNice product you can buy it without any problem
"The sound quality is excellent, no compromises there.The bass is beyond my expectations, very good.Noise cancellation is unreal: a little too much noise cancellation actually! I wouldn't wear these in traffic or I'll definitely miss some horns and indicators.Battery life is ample. One charge can get you about 6-7 hours of usage. The case can charge the buds about 4-5 times, so it's about 25-35 hours of use overall, based on how you use them.Con:The only con I have for it is that it's a little uncomfortable to wear for long durations. Now this might be a personal preference, but that's my only con.Good job Boat! 4/5"
"Well i was honestly a bit sceptical about buying these after reading through a ton of reviews and even when I ordered these i already had made up my mind about them and not in a good way might i add. But they’re really not all that bad. I mean sure there’s a bit of a lag here and there but it’s not something to fuss on. Sound quality I wouldn’t say is the best but it’s definitely above average. What i love about these is the bass. The bass is great for the price range. I compared them too JBL Bluetooth earbuds and JBL doesn’t have half the bass these have. So yeah, whatever."
"Battery inside the case till now I have charged the case only thrice though I don't use this airdrop oftenSound quality is goodBattery backup is also could can last around 6hrsCall quality is not good noise cancellation is really poor you will have to speak louder to be audible at other endAirdrop doesn't fit in ear properly is the only reason I am not able to use it, often it falls after sometimeIf you plug both earpiece you will hardly be able to listen anything sort from music."
After using it last 22days found a problem like it's  pairing with my phone but after playing music or connecting call not hear anything just like dead earbuds but when I connect this with the others phone it's work perfectly and also when I connect my phone with other Bluetooth devices that also work perfectly.I already did the factory reset but not solved the problem.Please help.
"If I have to describe in overall aspects it, it's pathetic. Only for listening music rest of features are waste. Frist it's only 4 hours of talk time including idle time after that you have to put it back in case. Second person at receiving end gets very pathetic sound quality and barely is able to hear what you want say. Third it has pathetic feature which switches off one of your earphone and it will not get switched on untill you put it back to case and reconnectThe only smart feature I liked about this product was that when someone calls you and you are listening to music it tells you name of person who is calling you"
I received boat airdopes 441 on 16 September 2020. Its not upto the mark but okay for budget TWS. Sound quality is not balanced and more of bass.Not recommended for long duration use. It pains the ears. There is also 2-3 second of latency.Battery and connectivity wise its good though.
"For music, this is great.But if you're looking for something that also serves as wireless earphones for video call/audio call, don't go for it. DO NOT GO FOR ITYou have to shout so that the microphone receives your voice and sends it to the other party.Music quality is great, battery life is good, IWP is great.But it's not for calling. I bought it mainly for calling and so was really disappointed."
"Its 100% jenuine review.The product is good.But after 16 days i bought the product the case started to heat automatically.I registered a complaint on boat support  site.The product is picked up and the fixed product returned after 23 days but the product is not the one which i was purchased ,not only that the colour also changed black to red.THIS IS A WORST SITUATION I FACED FROM BOAT SERVICE..U CAN BUY PRODUCT IT IS GOOD BUT NOT EXPECT A GOOD OR EVEN A AVERAGE SERVICE FROM THEM.THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ALSO VERY BAD...VERY BAD.BELIVE ME I DONT WANT TO WASTEY TIME BY WRITING THIS REVIEW SIMPLY.BUT THIS IS A GENUINE CASE"
I was a bit skeptical at first but once I purchased it on the Amazon sale..I am in love with it. The sound quality is amazing and once paired it connects directly as soon as the bluetooth is switched on. Definitely worth it at 1799.
"Bought it 2 days, returned it very next day. Absolutely disappointing. I had a very high expectations but it all come down when I tried it for 2 3 hours and it was a very sorry experience.I was inclined to buy tws but this absolutely rubbish in sound quality, hence went for enco m31 from oppo, and I am in love with it.Coming to 441,Pros:1. Case feels great in hand and durable.2. Airdopes also seems pretty well structured and feels good while handling. Touch capacitive is Plus but can be bothersome while calling as it hung up many times while adjusting it in my ear.3.USB CCons:1. STRONG BASS HEAD only go for it. There is very much predominance of bass that every other vocals and trebles is subdued. Using equaliser didn't work and made listening exp pretty bad.2. Call quality is very average as the other party continously complained of the noise and distorted voice. Don't buy it if you have to attend calls.3. Used it for 3 hours and it was painful. Somehow rubber grip didn't fit well in my ear and can be bothersome in long usage. Not everyone may be interfered though.Main reason for returning was BASS, I like bass but here it's not caliberated properly and it really started to bother you when you listen to it for more than 30 mins. Even less subtle songs had thumping effect. If you have such taste, who likes Full thumping in your ears, go for it. For me, on long usage it turned out to be painful."
"Unfortunately my product just stopped working in 20 days. And because the return window closed by then i had to get into the hassle of calling their customer care for their help because it was still in the warranty period. The call quality is just horrible, especially when it gets wet."
Very very Honest Review guys I have Purchased it yesterday and I was preety Excited about my boat Airpods After Watching lots of Video I have Finalized to buy boat 441 when I received it there is No bass First of All Don't buy it Sounds Quality is Good Noice Cancellation is poor I was shocked That other people are Written that it gives amazing bass wheather it have 0 bass in it...I'm very very disappointed...Amazon you have cheat on me ...
The product stopped working properly exactly after the return window of 10 days. When called they said you could have called us 4hrs prior return window for free replacement or cancellation of the order. Advised me to get it checked at the Boat Service Centre in this pandemic situation.Sometimes left side airdrop light goes off but working. Sometimes light blinks or only red light blinks but no sound from the airdrop. Very unusual behavior of the product.I think 10 days return window is not a great idea. Like in my case I called Customercare exactly on 11th day with few hours passed should be considered +- a day should be ok. Its like borderline. You have your own guidelines and procedures. May next 10 days or 20 days doorstep service/support by company should be their.
"i really wonder have any of these people who are giving a hype like thumping bass,sound quality and all have atleast tried a really good earphones first of all let me get straight my experience is,never expect a good sound quality from “TWS” honestly i have tried many all the tws by boat 441 171 281 etc; i could only say one thing none of these give better feel than boat rockerz 255 yes it is...!! i dont know why mightbe lack of a wire or anything if u are really buying these for enjoying music go for bluetooth wired like rockerz 255,boult probass,curve or anything you would like,if any of you know anything better than 441 which gives a good and loud sound suggest me.."
Sound quality is excellent..Just the capacitive buttons are problem. When you try to remove or put it in. It automatically takes the response lol. Atleast they need to set to double tap to pause. They just did 1 tap.
"Whatever I buy from online shopping, I always drop the true comments. So, let me share with you the reviews about Boat airdopes 441. The airdopes come with a very nice packaging and the box is also sealed with boat sticker. As soon as you open the box, the airdopes give a very shiny blink light. Talking about the sound quality, th noise cancellation is quite imperessive. There is no volume control in the airdopes and thats is not even required, use your phone instead to ajdust the volume. The upper and lower notes are clearly audible. Now, my favorite part, the bass- I am totally satisfied with the bass quality as it is quite high and smooth. This is a must huy for everyone in this proce range."
"Products from boat are always rocks.. I have been using this products since 5years still I loved the products.. and I am telling you something important here.Few are telling the product has issues, damaged too early or something else.. see when we buy a product the company will give user manual to tell u how to use it properly did you people read that? Ofcourse more than 90% will not read the manual.. you should.. tell me that what charger you are using to charge the product? you simply say Your mobile charger, do you think that company will give cable to u because of you don't have? No perfectly not, see when u read user manual you will know how to use the product, how to charge the product etc.. in this airdopes we got a cable, and case right in user manual they mentioned that 5V/2A adapter and cable to be used.. that they give cable because of they designed the cable that perfectly fits to the product if you use any other charger or cable to charge the product, that products obsolutely got damaged because of power supply is high see 500mah battery if use high supply cable the product will damage surely, so need attention for that.. and for battery backup you need to charge some extra time after charging got 100% for the first time... One more thing amazon don't give any promise on warranty that they will.. but from the manufacturer they do.. if you have any problem with any product you buy online.. if it's damaged later 7days or 1month or more.. you should go to official website of the product and register your problem they will come to u and solve your problem after 7days of return period amazon will not involve any problem for the product... So please understand.AI have bought 4ear phones from boat and one is damaged later 1month then I go to boat service online registered with invoice number and they come where they delivered my product and took them to the manufacturer and checked the product then they give me new one replacing the product these will happen within 15days of time period as they promise.So don't blame the manufacturer, just read the user manual they will tell you what to use what not to do.. how to use the product also learn to read user manual sometimes product got damaged because we don't use them properly... Very less cases there will be manufacturer damages.. so here I am mentioning my product review1. We can use it in Call that is good there is a noise cancellation also.2.Sound Quality is Good3. Products are good4. Perfect fit in ear5. Battery also good(use the cable that packed in the cable it's ok to be late sometimes)My overall product experience is good"
Product stops working twice after replacement again same issue.. I had purchased a Boat441 on 11th & 1st issue was there was no sound on 22nd October so i raised service ticket & got replacement product on 17th November but it's again stopped working on 5th December... Pls don't trust this PRC products i am suffering now with the service issue's now as now they are not generating fresh service request so escalated the issue in email but no reponse from them till now....
I m writing this review after 1month usage. It's awesome to listen songs. Bass and sound quality is very good. But when u r calling or receiving calls voice in not clear and breaking also while using single ear piece. By using both (pair) voice is not breaking but u need to talk loudly. So it has not so satisfied my needs. No need to for such higher range u can choose within 1200bucks.Thank you
"Sound, connectivity and build quality all good but the main issue is its battery life...The battery life of buds is good but the case is uncertain.... sometimes battery of case is zero after charging the buds twice or sometimes three times for charging single bud...Battery of case is mentioned 500 mah but i don't think so...Its battery is just 150 mah."
It works good with Mobile phone.....Sound quality is excellent but the issue comes while we use it with PC or laptop.The buds keep disconnecting and even if they connect the sound is not constant it goes off and comes back this keeps on going.If you are buying it for mobile phone then go for it but if you are buying for pc or laptop please don't buy you will regret!
"1. Sound quality is just average, on scale of 10 it's 4.5.2. Buds when fully charged can gives backup of 40 min, mind it that's the case I choose to write the reviewAfter every 40 min you just have put it back into case. It's more like monopod considering it's 40min backup.3. Bluetooth connectivity is also of poor range.4. With the price I pay (₹2499) function that pod support is just unexpectable, all you can do is play/pause.My suggestion, look for another brand than this cheap quality Chinese product."
"Noise static in left ear buds is biggest down side of this device its so annoying. Constant loud enough hissing while making phone calls.Bass is decent music quality is good i would say but when u listening to music the hissing sound is suppressed but in call u can hear it constantly and its damn annoying. When watching movie there are gaps in dialogue and the hissing takes the immersion of the movie completely awayIf there is no sound to play hissing continues for 3 4 secs to ruine any momentTLDR; dont go with rating. dont buy it. Its really bad. Sound quality doesnt mean anything when it ruines moment of immersion. Many buyers had complained but i thought maybe they got a bad piece since so many positive reviews and i was dead wrong, i already had the replacement and exactly same issue. its the fault of device design. This is not worth 2500 it should be worth 500 only."
"Pros:Good sound quality and noise cancelling, rapid and prolonged charging of the case, stylish, light and portable.Cons:A mild background electronic noise there when I am not playing any music. My ear hurts a bit when the dopes are placed in the ears, most likely due to tight fits."
"Quality is superbSound is superbConnectivity is superbBattery backup is superb, in the start it e will drain fast not that far but fast till two led remain and then it goes on good mode and bas chalte jaye chalte jaye like it don't need further charging anymore. It easily gives more than 1week of battery backup in my hand and I use it like all the time."
"Good bass and sound quality. Not sure about the noise cancellation. Single charge lasts 4-6 hrs, depending on the usage, but charging is really fast.The one issue is that it's not all that good for making calls. The voice gets muffled and is really feeble while speaking.Overall pretty good value for the money."
"I purchased the product on 28-12-2021, and the left earbud stopped working today 25-3-2022, its not working at all, its constantly blinking (green and blue) no matter how much i charge it.. no use.. the moment i take it out of the case its not showing the blue light and if i press it, its showing very less red light and the other one (working one) is showing more..I tried calling the number they provided with the warranty card but no use, this is utterly disappointing and unacceptable, i paid 2k and it didnt even last a year."
"Sound quality is good, connectivity is fine bass quality is so so, Bluetooth range is not up to tha mark just 4 and 5 meter,noise cancellation is bad,I am using from last two days so I am not very much familyer with the product.but my 2 days experience says product is not bad for this money."
"Go for it without any doubt! If you're a music lover you'd love it,especially the bass lovers. The mic works well too in indoor condition.I was confused at first by looking at the 6mm driver, but just don't go by the numbers, it's much more better than most of the 10mm drivers!The battery life is good too, I've used it continuously for 3hrs at around 70/80%volume, the charge was still 40%, which means it'll last between 4-5hrs.Overall it's a very good product at this price range."
"Sound quality- awesome, best at 60-70% volume. But don’t mind increasing more for more bass, but shouldn’t do it for long duration.Noise cancellation- satisfactory, tried in outdoor traffic, doesn’t completely shut off the background noise but does it satisfactorily.Calling: no problem, comfortable, no lagging.Gaming: 1/2 second lag, didn matter for me much as i m not that into games. But if you are then consider it.Grip: Perfect, didn fall even after vigorous exercise or jumping or turning sideways while  in bed."
"Please don't buy it, there is pathetic after sales service, my ear buds started making disturbing sound while in use that too just in a month. Now , boat service center is replaced it with refurbished piece which also has same issue , i again went and they again relaced it with refurbished which is again having same issue and even touch also not working this time.I never make comments but i am posting being very frustrated with boat service as they are not replacing with sealed pack new piece and all refurbished ones are having issues, Plz don't make ur money nd time wasting with boat product."
"Expected boat - an Indian product to be good. However, call audibility especially to recipient is very bad. Tried atleast 6 friends. Everyone said that voice quality is bad. Perhaps the mic facility isn't good. If you just want to hear music then its good but for calling honestly this isn't a good product. I returned it y'day and purchased Oneplus Buds Z. My friend was using it. I tried it. Voice calling was extremely good. boAt, we want you to improve as we want Indian designed products to flourish. Please work on PRIORITY in correcting such BIG and APPARENT gaps."
"Good bass, good sound quality,good buy,its doesn't fall once fixed properly,it shud be held from edge while pressing in ur ear in a circular clock-anticlock wise. Its light,ear doesn't pain at all even if u wear it for hours.....BUT NOISE CANCELLATION is bad,So if u travelling in a rickshaw,u definitely cant be heard to others..... but if u are driving in a car with windows closed..... it's fine. So if u are buy it for talking calls in traffic then u must avoid it.....otherwise it a good product in this price...."
"It has just been 6 months and the left one of the pair has stopped working and doesn't even get charged. Maybe these pairs are at such great discount for the same reason. There's no return or warranty on these.More so I didn't even enjoy listening to songs with these on. There wasn't an option to return and hence had to stick to it.I also went through the other reviews wherein people have expressed the same concerns. If 2.5K to 3K doesn't really matter to you, please go ahead and purchase.Last but not the lease, do not think of gifting this to your loved ones, seriously!"
"Average product. It seems to be less efficient with the battery after some weeks.Might face some problems with connectivity.Sound quality is fare, not great, dominates with its bass. Less clarity of sound. Mic is worse, can consider it as mic. Less comfortable. Over priced product."
"Pros# Good sound quality# Excellent battery backup# Good looking# Fits well# No chance of falling off# Perfect for doing workouts, running, etc# Excellent micCons# Slight delay in sound, can only be observed while playing games.Otherwise no issues"
Sound quality is very good. Bass quality is also very nice. There is passive noise cancellation. But now after 3 months its left earbud is not working.Please help me out about this issue.
"There are many disadvantages but comparing to the advantages it's not a big deal. But for this price range it is excellent. They added many features like voice assistant, change the music, instant wake, accept or reject the call etc. There is something I wish this TWS could have like showing charge for the case in the phone, showing charge for each, more battery."
"The buds don't fit in the ear properly and you need to constantly keep checking it to make sure it doesn't fall off. If you sit still, then the sound and bass quality is very good but if you move even slightly you'll feel the difference. If you're to bend down with the buds in your ear, you'll actually feel it slipping off and falling. The fitting issue is so great that I have to purchase another pair of headphones/earphones but it definitely won't be any product from this company. I regret not listening to my friend who advised me against buying this product or any product from this company in general."
"Awesome sound quality and bass ..very nice product at this cost .I am very happy to purchase boat441 airdopes .I am suggest to all my friends  to purchase this one. Boat is my favorite forever.I want to say something about amazon.I ordered yesterday night at 11pm and I got today at 1PM super fast delivery with prime ,I have never ever seen this much of fastest delivery in my entire life..I love amazon..Thanks."
"Hi All,If your priority is music and if you dont play any games, you should buy this. The build, design, fit and sound quality is great. I was really enjoying this product untill I tried to play CSGO using this. It absolutely ruined the deal for me. The latency feels >1s. BT 5.0 caused minute stutters. This is just not made for gaming.Hope this helps.Thanks & Regards"
"The audio quality while taking a call is pathetic , you can use just to listen to music for which it is best suited.But mind you , you can't listen to music while jogging or brisk walking in this ..because it does not stay in your ear from slightest jolt."
"After seeing lots of videos on YouTube and reviews - We ordered this product. But to be honest, we didn't like it much. Once you put it in your ears, it creates a vacuum and start hurting your ears within 15-20 minutes. Sound quality is just average. The only plus point is the battery backup. Also the left side ear bud doesn't fit properly inside the case and sometimes don't get charged even after having a magnetic hold. We use it in GYM and it doesn't fall from your ear. But if your trainer/friend speaks to you, you have to take it off from your ear to listen."
"My OnePlus buds abruptly stopped working, and without any service centres in my location I decided to buy a new one with a comparatively lower investment. Then I got a pair of Boat Buds (Masaba Edition).Pros: Packaging, Sound Quality, Comfort, Case, BassCons: Touch sensor. If you accidentally tap the touch area, the surface is so sensitive that it reacts instantaneously without even applying any pressure. You've to handle the buds like nuclear weapons if you don't want to accidentally play/pause your music, movie, series etc."
"Value for money.Boat can think of redesigning it, on continuous usage, slight pain in the ear ( in the holding point of the earpod) check and use little suffosicated one."
"I bought it with great expectations by seeing other reviews, so heres my genuine review about the product:PROS:--great design and amazing fit-cannot be seen when woreCONS:--too high bass!  ( so much that it distorts the whole music experiance)-Poor vocal clarity! ( due to high bass, the vocals arent even clear so its very disturbing for a music lover)-touch area ( the touch area is very big and hence each time you try to wear it or remove you're gonna either pause or play the music and thats very annoying)So i exchanged the product and bought boult audio airbass propods and i must say it is the one i was looking up for!✌️"
"I'm using these headphones for 2 monthsEverything us good long lasting battery life, each earbud gives 12 to 16 hrs battery life.Sound quality is good noise cancellation is not as it is claimed. While driving a car works normal like in a room but while riding a bike, my voice is not audible to the person on other side of phone call, each time I need to slowdown my bike and than talk. This is tha only drawback I found."
"There is issue with left Ear TWS airdope. The sound cracks on high volume & battery of left TWS drains much earlier than right TWS.I got 1st package with multiple issues like frequent bluetooth disconnections while voice calls, cracking noise in left airdope, battery drainage of left airdope. Even the Airdopes were not getting auto disconnected after putting them in case.I called for replacement & fortunately the seller sent me the replacement much earlier.The sound & bass quality of this 441 Airdope is better with its 6 MM driver than Realme Q 10 MM driver eardopes.In my opinion, its better to listen this TWS around 60-70% volume to avoid cracking sound. Also, my replaced Airdopes are giving better battery backup now. It runs around 4-5 hours.I hope you my review will be helpful for new buyers."
"Within this price range its really too good in listening music, attending meetings,watching videos and all day to day works everything's nice. But when it comes to gaming the sound is really too good but you will feel a delay of 1.5 secs or 2 secs."
"The airdopes stopped working abruptly within 3 months. The sounds seems to be crackling. First I thought it was my phone issue. I tried with another handset but the issue still remains. The left side airdopes feels warm as I'm writing this review. Lost the trust and my money.Hi All,  The Boat company have send a replacement 2 weeks for the defeticve item and I'm satisfied with their response although a little delay but that's understandable due to covid-19 pandemic. I thank all the individuals involved directly and indirectly during this process.  I was busy with work, so couldn't share my view before."
"The boat airdopes are totally worth the money. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is also very good. I bought this 3 months ago and it still has no issues. I have accidentally dropped the airdopes from my hands and no damage is seen as the build quality is also very good. If you have a little extra cash then go for the pro version of this product as the case will also work as a mini powerbank.Noise cancellation when talking is okay okay. When I talked with the airdopes on, the other person would hear noise and I have to talk louder in order for them to listen properly.Overall product is very good and the ear pieces won't come out of your ears as they fit very nicely."
The earphones have a great sound quality and are very comfortable . The is no insecurity when wearing the earphones as they fit just right and are very light weight. Due to the perfect fit in the ears most of the ambient noise is left out. The touch controls are also great and have a perfect amount of sensitivity. The charging case is light and very convenient to carry around and the battery backup is also sufficient.
"I used this eardopes for couiple of monthPros:Connectivity is flawless!Battery is good!It fits well!Cons:It's so damn worst in sound quality!Sond is so worst in treble!Tust me all positive reviews are fake as far as sound qality is in picture!!!But I used it beacuse it is so good looking, it's almost like fashion statement but it's worst tws I used! Currently earphones I'm using is boat 421 you can get it at same price point but they are 3x better in sound and battery backup is better...🙂"
"Worst noice cancellation ever100/- rs wired headphones are far better when it comes to noice cancellation 🙏🏻No extra rubber budsNot exactly comfortable for earsTouch controls are worst worst worstWhen u r on cal if you suddenly touch the buds by any soft materials, cal gets cutFinally don't go for it 🙏🏻"
The airpods r super. I was really worried about buying the boat airdopes 441 pro. Because there were no reviews of this model. But it is more worthy than the price segment. I have used Products of boat previously it never disappointed me. Seems like boat has built it's trust for me.The airdopes r just amazing.Super bass.Clear sound quality.Battery case also can b used as powerbank in emergency.Audio calling is all ohkay.No issues in connectivity.Extra earbuds nd type-C cable is also provided.I highly recommend this guy's. Trust me it's gonna b worth it.Nd we r also getting 1 year warranty.Remaining is upto u.
"Bass heads, look no more. Guys who need NC, LOOK NO MORE! THIS IS IT! The build quality was poor on the on I received as the lid was super loose but Amazon took care of it :)If you want a bit of premium feel as well, skip this. Else the Masaba edition is fantastic and does not look like a toy as compared to other colors."
The sound quality is low..the volume is very less and can be controlled only by phone..they could do better by giving it its own volume control.. even phone's volume should be at max to hear something clearly..used it only once and now sitting in the cabinet gathering dust
"having use dit for 2 months nowPros:Good music even at high volumeGood bassfits nicely in the ear with different size budsDoes not fall off easilyCons:cannot be used for long, ear achesProlonged usage causes headacheCannot be used for voice calls as claimed by many. Suitable only in a closed noiseless room for voice calls.Overall: Serves the purpose of hearing music for a hour or 90mins activity. Cannot be used for calls when going out or in open. Worth to be bough only at deal price or lesser."
An excellent product for this price. Those who loves JBL earphones for sure will love it. Charge lasts for 18 hrs. Easy to carry and beware while sleeping it will fall out of your ears. It is as equal as ear ring. Will review again after a month.
Bad product. The fitment in the ear is good The bass quality is good but leaves a lot for sound quality. Now the biggest problem for me - The left ear piece stops working after 30 minutes of usage. When you put them for charge then the color shows as fully charged. Cant even use for 2 continuous hours. Complicated color combination (in the manual there is no mention about what does Red color mean). Zero noise cancellation. This was my first boat purchase and completely disappointed.
"Fits perfectly on the ears, Good sound quality and voice cancellation, Budget friendly, Automatic turn on,  pairing and turn off functions.Cons: Touch sensor is super sensitive, so it's get turned off or misclicked when you lie one sided. Even it turned off when you drive with helmet. So not useful to get audio directions with this headsets."
"I'm using this for more than 2 months for now.  It got a great sound and bass quality is superb.The only thing in negative is it doesn't have volume controls though they specified in the description.  Overall it's a great product,  highly recommend"
Always wanted to Go for this. This is a great product. Using since 1 month. Everyday maximum 30 minutes. Charging can run upto 15 days with a full charge. Good sound. Enable Dolby in your phones or lappys. Sit back and enjoy.
"Totally this one utter waste,no noise reduction, recipient couldn't listen our voice properly. Moreover its sound quality is really too horrible. Voice is too low and not able to listen opponent voice"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I use this from last one month and I hadn't need to charge yet.Its battery backup is so good.Bass and sound quality also perform well.Case was user friendly.On call their is to much noise capture, noise cancellation is to low.Some time tuch not work properly and some time little tuch end your  call."
"The plastic tip of the ear bud is most annoying. It isn't fitting well inside the ear. Can't sit with it for long hours as it's very troubling. Moreover the CTC (ie the touch response system) is also very poor. You have to press really very hard to get a response (which too very late). Left earbud's CTC wasn't working properly. Plus you need to push the earbud deep inside your ear to fit in, which makes you completely deaf. You can't hear anything of the outside world. A very bad experience with such a sophisticated item."
100 percent best ….I never charged this since the day first and works till now with 70% charge in the case and been already 5 days so it’s the best for long usage but3. It pains in your ear since the rubber rubs around your ear and might would have Done it better but at this price range this is the best earphone in Bluetooth segmentHONEST REVIEW
"The sound quality is perfect, especially the bass is perfect not too high not too low.Clear call sound.Battery backup is nice.The look and feel of the device and the case are beautiful.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wishes to buy the best earbuds at a low price segment of around 2k."
"My Airdopes had low volume problem on left side within a month. As per warranty this was picked up, tested and a replacement was “issued”as per the updates on their website. After 10 days the replacements are yet to be dispatched. Looks like money down the drain! No response to mails. Twitter shows many more examples. If you plan to buy this, forget about warranty and if you claim warranty forget about getting back the replaced product. In short if you product has a problem it gets picked up and never gets returned back and there is no way of contacting customer care. MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN #boAt"
Voice is coming v low while calling. the opposite person is feeling difficult in getting voice to understand and some times when we are in office we can’t talk loudly that’s the biggest drawback in this set. in Rest other features all are. Gud bcz of low voice. If you are depending on calls more I won’t suggest you thz. It is for listening music
"I got it at 2299I like this product specially bass is good, sound quality is also good,The only thing i have noticed is if you wear helmet and you wanna use this while driving if someone calls you conversation will be little difficult you have to stop bike remove helmet and you can continue talking.Well after all satisfied with this product overall performance is amazing😊"
Sound quality = FantasticNoise cancellation = good but can improveBuild quality =  Excellent touch works well Sound does not comes out of buds even the person right near you will not be able to hear anything what are u listening that is the biggest plus point i likeBuying this product under 2k is a very good deal as compare to other options avaliable under this priceOne problem have comr till date that sometimes left  ear buds  stops working which gets fixed when we do the factory reset which hardly takes  7 seconds.
"Product stops working as expected on one ear bud in about 20 days and though the product is under warranty, the support is absolutely pathetic. In spite of creating request highlighting the issue, there is no acknowledgement nor any response to solve the problem.Tried several simple remedies to correct the issue such as pair, unpair, pair one ear bud only and so on and still it didn’t solve."
"Writing the review after 1 month of usage,In Bud charge lasts for 4 hours for music and 2.5 hours for callsCase Charge - I have drained the buds completely and charged it full with the case more than 16 times still the case holds one point charge.Touch on the buds is too sensitive which results in unnecessary inputs most of the time.Case could have been made better quality. Apart from the touch sensitivity no cons for this product considering the price"
"Bought it for 2500/-Sound is goodYes , the bass is more , but I like thatThe battery is just too good , I haven't charged my earpods for last 2 weeks still it's showing 2 bars that's 50% battery . So the battery is just amazing which was the main factor for me while buying these earphonesCall quality is okayish, not bad ,but not that great either, the person on the other end experienced some noiseOverall I love this product, it's great ."
This is a very nice pair of earbudsConsidering the price of the earbuds here are it's pros and cons:Pros:1) GREAT BASS2)FAST PAURING SPEED3 STYLISH AND GOOD LOOKING4) AMAZING BUILD QUALITY5) GOOD MICROPHONE6)VERY ACCURATE TOUCH CONTROLS7) GREAT BATTERY LIFE8) IT HAS PEBBLE SHAPED DESIGNED WHICH IS VEY GOOD TO FIT INTO POCKETCONS:1) IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY GAME THEN PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. THE SOUND LAGS VERY MUCH
"Poor sound and Mic , no sound cancellation, music and sound quality not worth for the price. Battery drain very fast. Case have just 500 mah.If you are spending 1800 to 2500 better to go Philips or Jabra .Amazon doesn't mention country of origin so better to check if you are willing to buy only make in India/ made in India product. This product is manufactured in People republic of China. Boat Just had mention made in PRC.Better to don't use this."
"Overall Sound Quality is very good and Bass is great as well. The only problem I faced and what I think made my review lose two stars is the Mic. The mic works well in phones but does not work with a computer. Even though it displays connected for voice. I have tested other boat airdopes, they work perfectly fine. I have also tested other companies TWS earphones. They also work fine. I have also checked all possible settings on my computer ( Windows). I also tried using them with Linux. None of my efforts worked. I even replaced my order from amazon, thinking there might be a defect in my particular piece. That was also not the case. There is some problem with the model itself. I hope Boat wold see this review and check the product."
Good product. Works well. Blue Tooth Pairing is fast. Only problem is that it can make hearing sounds around you difficult to hear. Battery life is ok. One interesting thing is two people can listen at the same time by using one bud each 😀
This is a good product but in this earpods there is noo noise cancellation system... Soo by this we can't talk using this product at outside or by riding etc...It is usefull for only home purposes like listening songs and audio... But atleast it is not usefull for gaming.. I experience very bad in gaming that means the sound deliver in slow or late... And the bass is okkk or good enough...
"These 441 pro worth the price. The Sound is Good & Clear and the bass, just killing. The built quality of case and buds is neat. I am using this since Jan'21 and it's almost 1 year. It worked good for first 11 months, after that i felt sound from the right buds slightly reduced. Thereby I registered a complaint and they collect my earbuds after 2 days. They replaced my product and it reached for me on the 5th day from the day they picked up. Right now it's working perfectly and I almost accidentally slipped the new earbuds almost 3 times from several height. It doesn't failed to impress!"
Great earbuds. The quality is premium and it feels and looks good in ears. Also doesn't hurt at all and are very comfortable. The sound quality is excellent and connect very easily. The battery backup is awesome with the case. Great product!!
They are good enough to listen to music. The sound is OK for the price they won't blow your mind away. The bass is too much for someone who owns a better pair of headphones and it perfectly fine for someone who doesn't care about how their music sounds. It is what you pay for. But..... The mic is absolutely bad. It will not pick up your voice in windy conditions
"Bad quality. Did not last even 3 months. The left cup stopped charging. Tried factory reset, but did not work. Worst of all there is no service centre of this brand in my city. So, I guess these are going to the bin. Waste of 2500 Rs. Better to go for reputed brands such as Sony."
"Product is good. However bass is too high, if you are a bass lover this product is for you. I took this only for calling purpose as I talk a lot with my girlfriend. Attached is my picture to see how it fits in ear. It doesn't come out of ear and fits well. Very good for gym workouts. I have received this today. Will post reviews after 10 days. The bass is too heavy and gives pain in your ear. I don't even think of keeping it for 10 minutes.Anand Achrekar"
"Not bad but price is little bit high.Sound quality is goodBattery back up is good, we can say.Music quality is good but bass quality is not too good as I expected.For gaming like PubG and Call of duty, sound quality is very good.For calling, I like it."
"Sound quality is good but bass is only available at high volume, and at high volume vocals are very high, which irritates.Connectivity is fine and indicating lights are good.Noise cancellation only available from medium volume range.Charges fast and lasts long.The only limitation isBass is only available at full volumeAnd full volume is unbearable and not safe for ears.At medium volume levelThis product is fine with little bass.Don't know about water Resistance."
Best shot of this product is stylish look of both buds and case and this is why I purchased the itemBass is good  sound quality is also good but problems I noticed areIrregular charge btwn the 2 buds.right bud discharge very fastlyRight earbud not fit so well it falls of frequently.When it come to calls other person voice Is audible but ours is not  that audible to other one on call.They disconnect frequently..most weird thing is bluetooth connection is active but wen i make calls the I can't hear to the other person so I thought they got disconnected but it isn't.When come to noise other person on calls hears more noise.So I returned this product as once I got exchange once and again I noticed same problems so I returned the product. But thanks to amazon they responded to this exchange and return. Looking over for good tws now.
"I have received on time but this product was having mic issues i have reported this issue with boat but till date I haven't getting solutions ,boat has taken for replacement but not resolve yet this issue very poor service of boat I am very disappointed with this behaviour of branded company ,boat replaced this and sent another airdopes with damage and right airdopes was not working conditions again I have complained with boat but. Very poor service level.I want refund my amount but they are not agree to refund amounts .Please help."
"Actually there is a small issue(bug) in this earphones ,low noise will come from right ear phone which we can observe in a pleasant place, I got replacement for this issue but the new one is also having same problem so it might be the issue with product ,please do check when u got the product"
Sound too low compared to earbuds in this range. No voice indication on turning on or off. No voice indication on call etc.... only beep sound. Only look wise good. Not by performance. Boat has created hype with ads & marketing but lags in performance. Try yourself and compare with other earbuds.
I don't like this product... One of the earbuds is not working... But yes base of this product is so good... The way it work is also good I personally don't like this product becoz it doesn't fit in my ears Nd the sensetive touch is quite irritating... If u adjust the earbuds calls cut down or songs just stop so... Even u can't use this earbuds while relaxing or sleeping position so I am returning it
"Review after a week of using it.The airdopes sound quality:The bass is too high also doesn't actually sounds good with all genres of music.Comfort:Since it's sensor adapted it shuts down if put even a minute pressure.Calls gets cancelled out even if you're trying to adjust the airdopes.Falls off the ear easily, so it isn't a sturdy one if you're buying it for workouts or even for a walk.Not at all comfortable.Charging:The charging stays for a decent time.That's the only pro about this product.Case:Well the case isn't closing within a week of use and I guess it's broken.Bluetooth adaptability:One of the airdope shuts down inbetween while using, then connects only when encased and reconnected which ends up wasting apmle time."
"Although the sound quality is great . There are few issues with this product-1) it cannot be used for long time because it causes pain in the ear due to its structure 2) you can't connect to the FM through this 3) sometimes it causes issues while connecting to a phonecall 4) also when being on a phone call ,the other person is sometimes unable to hear5) it also has some connectivity issues , it takes a longer time to connect to the device"
within a week the right earbud stop charging. Bangalore has only one autorized service center which is 25kms from my place. Banded over to service center and they need 15 days to replace. further the pod does not sit properly in the charger.. poor quality control.
"This product was got in ₹1999 on Amazon Great Indian sale and its pathetic. First the earbuds are not made for Indian ears. Sony earphones are far far better in ergonomics.Got it because I had used Boat Rockers 700 headphones earlier and they were pretty good. These ones are pathetic.Also its not even water resistant. Forget dipping on water, I just touched the leftearphone after washing my hands and lightly toweling my hands and it stopping working.Sounds is too low, unless you are 90% up in volume. You won't be able to hear anything.Noise cancellation is a joke.Better leave the product and buy something else.Post 8-10 meters you will hear sound in any one of the earphones."
"I know my return window has exhausted, but would still like to add my review. I didn't like this product at all, won't recommend anyone to go for it. The pairing breaks in between for no reason and all of your time just gets wasted in resetting or pairing them again. I have hardly used 8-10 times since those have been received, but feel very upset on the quality that Boat has to offer.Apologies if the review hurt anyone, but utter wastage of money and effort."
Definitely its not a good product in terms if sound and battery backup.it sounds loses its smoothness when its on higher side.as per description it will give 30hr backup with case.but its heardly lasts 10 hrs.not or never a competitive with sony or jbl.this is my 2nd product from boat and i realy feel its my big mistake to chose boat again.earliar product also is a mistake
"Received this product yesterday. The packaging and designing is good.When you connect your left earpiece, constant noise comes and it is very irritating.If you wear this earpods for more than an hour, you ears might start paining.If you Play some mobile fames connecting these earpods, there is a major lag in the sound and the game..Needs major update or rectification. I may change the product once its available again."
"Pretty decent earphone by BoAt in a range of bright colours.But do not fall prey for Amazon's Lightning Deal like me. I bought the product in Lightning Deal for Rs1999, when the actual price was showing as Rs2499.But a couple of days after Lightning Deal was over, the actual price was reduced to Rs1799. So I have basically paid Rs200 extra, thinking that I have made a profit."
"Only 2 drawbacks are - my ear hurts after some time because of the pad (the fan shaped rubber to cling to the ear securely), and if mistakenly the airdopes are touched, the song pauses or call ends (as it is touch controlled).Otherwise it is very good product. I did not check the mobile charging feature yet."
Mic stopped working. I can play music but cant received and call using earbuds. Have reset to factory setting multiple time but it is not working.Customer service is pathetic. After registering multiple times and even sending email no response. Finally able to contact customer service and they said do reset and cut the call abruptly.I will not recommend to go for Boat products
Awesome product in this prize range* It's my first ever truly wireless earbuds and the sound quality is very good. Bass quality is awesome at high volume.* During call mono earbuds can be used.* Earbuds are really light weight and easy to fit in ear and during workout it never falls off the ears.*Rgb lighting and touch gives premium looks.
"Bought for ₹2,499/- there were several issues, primarily connectivity issues, battery issues, static issues etc. One of the airpods functions completely independent of the other, which is very annoying. The battery backup promised to last for at least 5 hours didn't last for more than 3 in actuality.The delivery was fine & on time though.I had purchased this product with very high hopes & really didn't wanna give up so requested a replacement which turned out to be worse than the first one. This clearly looked like a fake, cheap imitation of the original product. On connecting to my laptop, the airdopes produced the worst kind of sound. There were terrible connitivity issues. One of the airpods kept blinking & the other didn't ever stir. The battery backup wasn't great either. The case looked terribly brittle & in a precarious condition & position. The right airdope kept functioning independently of the left one which was really annoying.Completely frustrated, I spoke to Amazon for a replacement to which they denied & said that only a return was possible & it was really off putting since that meant a loss of discount received for me. Now I would have to pay approximately ₹250 to buy the same product (although I'm never gonna go that). The Amazon team kept repeating their unmeant & unfelt apologies & assured me that a technical team would contact me within 24 hours & a swift redressal of my issues would be effected. However nothing happened & I was ultimately forced to return it at a loss of 10%.The sound quality is not up to the mark, there is no noise cancellation whatsoever, active or passive, the airdopes hurt your earlobes & are prone to falling off, no matter how much they assure you otherwise. The bass quality isn't that great either, at higher volumes it gives you a headache.This product clearly looks like a cheap chinese knock off, I wouldn't recommend it to any sensible buyer."
"So I bought these basis reviews in lightening deal. But it’s damn useless no noise cancellation, the other person can’t hear me, voice keeps breaking, issues in connection. Initially I thought it may be my network issue but later realised the quality is worst of the product."
"The airdopes from Boat look attractive, have a decent playback time, you can take these only for music and not for calls. There is zero background noise suppression which leads to excessive disturbance while talking. Even in a quiet room, it is difficult to talk.No mono mode available which is another disadvantage.I would not recommend anyone to but these, totally worthless as it doesn’t solve the purpose"
Just best in classsPros:-- every thing is perfect.- bass good- sound good- noise cancellation good- case is rigid- charging keeps up for good time-Cons:-- just not good to take calls.- not good to use for long time (it hearts)- not good to create reels (music comes little  late)- doesn't record noise (may be some one hunting for that)
"Sound :-You cant find sound of wired earphones in witeless but they do perform well enough to let you enjoy songs and movies , I loved the party ones mostly , songs which are soulful would be needed to lessen a voice bit , cant hear them at full volume.Design :-The case is just 7cm long and the buds are cute and small enough to fit your ears , yiu strictly need to choose good hooks for painless and great fit to your ears , for running 3kms you will enjoy bigger hooks but for long time of listening you definitely need to fit it with smaller ones .Bass & Treble :-They're Bass Friendly , so you will have no issue listening groovy songs or watching powerpacked action movies , you can hear everything clearly , for a normal people these are great unless you are not full blown audiophile .Calling & Noise Cancellation :-This is mixed department , sometimes calls were good but only sometimes , for short calls and if you just have to answer , these are good , for long calls you definitely need better call noise Isolation which is slightly disappointing here , you cant talk at all in noisy environment , even frogs could be heard more than my voice when I tried talking through them .In Short :-They Are Good , Best In 2k , I Bought Them In Prime Day Sale ."
"I purchased this thing on Jan . The product is good at this price range. And initially the perfomance was good. But after 3 months the backup has reduced drastically . I returned it for services , they offered me a fake promise that I will be given a replacement for it. But I received the same thing I returned. The service was poor and I had to return the item 3 times in a month . Still I am having the same defected one. So anyone who is planning to buy this one please understand if any problem arises for you item you are doomed. Your money is gone. No good service at all."
I'm using the product for more than 6 months it was ok but but after sometime there was some issues with the sound so i registered the complaint and i got the product replaced after 10 days of waiting and guess what i received the faulty product now when i contact the customer care they are telling me to register the complaint once again so that means i have to wait for another 10-15 days and after that waiting there is a chance of getting faulty product. So only buy the boat products if you have their service center near your location.
"Pros :- Amazing sound with rich bass.- Amazing battery life. Haven't required to charge in the past 3 weeks.- Insta wake and pair is a surprise. You never have to get into the hassles of pairing.Cons:- Miss the volume controls on the earbuds.- The case is bit heavier and bulkier than the previous modelsOverall, an excellent companion fo the music lovers and those who prefer to listen through earphones / headphones. Totally woth the price!!!"
Such a wonderful product. Everything is perfectly balanced the sound is also awesome. Got delivered today afternoon giving review after 5 hours of use. And as many people were complaining about some weird noise in the left ear I did not face any issues with that as well. Must buy product don't give it a second thought just go for it.

"I am writing this review after using 2 months.My first order left side ear buds had some problems and it was replaced with new one .I am using this since last 2 months and truste me it is too good and value for money.Bass quality and sound quality is awesome ,if you are a music lover then I recommend you to buy this one . battery backup also good ."
1.The first look design and the package is really good.2.the airdopes has a very good clear and crispy audio....and also very good bassNOTE:pls hear at a volume of 80 to 85...if u go beyond that u will start to get headache3.The reason for giving 4 star and not 5 star is...the play and pause control does not work properly on pc..but it works very good on mobile....its the only con of this product4.Battery backup is really good...5.if u want to get a nice and worth for money earbuds ....pls go for this6.The IWP technology is working really well7.Its also waterproof and touch control is very sensitive....
The sound quality is GOOD but not too Great. Noise cancelling is Average. Fittings are Good in ears. Very stylish and built is of good quality. Battery life is also Good.But faced some problems in Accepting calls and rejecting calls sometimes.Faced lags when connected to PC and Laptops.OVERALL THE PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT CAN BE BETTER OR BEST.
"This is my first set of wireless earphones. My experience for this is really good, the sound quality is really good with good bass too. These are extremely steady and fits my ears perfectly. Battery life is also good. My requirement for this apart from music is also for calling, and that's where it doesnt get a perfect score. For calling purpose, there is slight disturbance and also, people on other side often hear background noise at my end.All an all a perfect buy if your requirement is for music at this price point."
"This is really a bad product, after using this for more than 3 months , I literally want to throw them away. Pathetic sound quality coupled with crazy microphone which catches loads of background noice. And it also has very popr design, touch capacitive buttons are so sensitive that it impossible to remove earphone without activating the touch, even if you have to adjust the earpieces you need to touch the button which end up the call pr stops the music. I literally want to meet the guy who designed touch button on these.Please don't buy these, they are really useless."
"Before buying first u know about BOAT warranty and replacement procedure.....my complain no is- 1623793. On 10 of Oct20 they have collected my Airpodes from me for replacement, approx 1 month is going to be over but still i m waiting for my Airpodes. I will get it back or not ....dont know......using just 15 days its one of them is start creating noise in background .......worse product by Boat........disgusting"
"4 Star has four pros and 1 Star less is for one cons.Pros:Awesome SoundGreat Connectivity with IWPDecent Bass, enough for meMonster Battery backup, almost 7days with caseCons:Don’t depend on mic while calling. It will hardly catch your voice. You have to literally shout to let the opposite peson hear."
"A nearly perfect earbud within budget. I have been using it for last 8 months, and I have loved it so far as a whole.Pros:1)The main feature of this product is sound quality which is really good2)Build quality, size and shape are absolutely fine and comfortable3)Charging time is really quick4)The in-built power-bank feature is really helpful sometimesCons:1)There are connectivity issues sometimes2)The microphone sometimes malfunctions during phone callOverall, this is a nice product by Boat!"
Using it for a month now withIpone and oneplus.Good product ti have in this price range.Both ear buds work good separately as well.Sound quality is great and so is bass.Noise cancelation is not that good.Good battery backup.It almost go for more than 8 hrs nonstop when fully charged .Good product.
"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of extensive usage.Design: 4/5. It's small and eartips out of the box are comfortable. It fits perfectly in my ears. The big eartips had better passive noise cancellation. Although the small hooks provided really caused pain in my ears. Eventhough it's made of rubber, it didn't adjust properly or simply was not made for my ear. But it's removable so I bid goodbye to that ear hooks and now no pain at all.Sound quality: 4/5. It's fairly great. Bass is decent, treble and highs and lows arr balanced. No noticeable distortion at high volume too. But if you are a gamer and you need to hear footsteps to play, you will be disappointed with any other TWS at this price range, let alone this one. Because it has a significant amount of latency. So not recommended for gaming.Battery: 4/5. I listen my songs and watch videos all at 100% volume at all times. So at a stretch the earphones lasted me around 4 hours straight. And with the box, considering I use the earphones for approximately 4 to 5 hours a day, the charge in the case lasted me for an entire week until I had to recharge it again. It has almost become a routine that I have to charge it in every Mondays.Misc: 3.5/5. Considering sweat proof feature, it's fairly decent. It withstood my daily workouts and cardio. And the CTC is extremely sensitive. It responds to even minute accidental touches. And when I lie down, the accidental touch by the pillow causes it to pause my song. Although over a week of usage, I got used to it and so would you.And the connectivity is very good. You switch the Bluetooth on on your phone, and then open the box and it will get connected ( for the very 1st time of usage, you need to connect it manually) automatically. And the range is also decent. I leave my phone charging at one room and I wander around my house still it doesn't get disconnected.And there's one issue with the earphones. There is some kind of static noise in few apps. For me it happened while playing COC. It's low in volume but still noticeable, and at times annoying but I am used to it now. This issue and the fact that I had to remove the rubber earhooks to be comfortable are the only noticeable cons to this TWS to me.Conclusion: Overall a very good product. It's my first body product and tbh I am not disappointed. It's an all-rounder. Good sound quality, decent battery, good design. I don't know about other TWS at this range but according to me, for 2k it's pretty much worth the money."
"A problem that I faced was,1. The part from where the pods get charged was giving me minor shock on my ear.2. It's is not that comfortable to wear after a while it becomes painful.3. Sometimes the pods heat up don't know why!!Now the Best part1. Sound & Bass Quality is good2. Noise Cancellation is good3. Long Battery life4. Type-C charging is great5. Small Case"
"Sound quality and built quality is really amazingThis one is best for those who loves bass and have rough use 😉I have use 7-8 hours a day and it's battery is really last long up to 30-34 hours with caseNoise cancellation is also great while calling, it feels like original microphone quality while calling, that's greatI haven't use it for gaming but I'm sure it's good because of low latency and blutooth 5.0.."
"The boAt Airdopes 441 worked fine for three months. After that the Airdopes started showing issues. I contacted the customer service since it is with in warranty period, but even after 5-6 follow-ups, the issue is not getting resolved. For every email, the customer service will put some sugar coated reply, but they don't do anything to resolve the problem.I have decided not to buy any boat devices from now, due to their pathetic customer service."
"Better than what i though it would be . Better quality, better sound , bass and noice cancellation. On call a bit low sounding for theother person. Touch feature is good sometimes but not when it comes to wearing helmet and traveling"
"I bought this product hoping to get mediocre sound with good build, build part was as expected bluetooth pairing and overall usage experience was also pretty good. But the sound on these earphones is very unbalanced a LOT of thumpy bass to the point where it suppresses every other sound in a song , the bass tires your ear , i adjusted it with equaliser but then it reduced the sound quality overall.Only buy this if you are literally a bass head(a thumpy one not the deep bass kind) because it thumps your skull rendering you buzzed out."
"I was very sceptical initially. It's been 2 months and everything works well. I wanted to give 5 star rating but I'm giving 4 since there is a small noise heard from left ear bud, it doesn't interfere with the sound quality though. Bass is fantastic, sound quality is really good and noise cancellation is average. Overall, I'm happy with the product."
"I bought this TWS on monday and i am testing it alote. I was almost 1 week unit i am using them.1. From bass point of view, these TWS are  awesome.2. Battery life of these, on a single charge  is about maximum 4 hours only. But the  company claimed that it gives playback  of  5 hours.3. It comes with IPX7 technology.4. The voice experience is very good in  songs.5. But at last to be very honest there is a  problem in connectivity. Means  sometime the connection get lost by its  own and we have to restart the  Bluetooth.6. And secondly the battery drains very fast  after 80%.7. I also want to mention that the design of  eardopes is also not that comfortable.  My ears start paining after usage of 3  and a half hours.8. There is a huge latency while playing  video on you tube or some other videos  also.  I want you to consider these points.  I am telling these things by my own  experience."
"The sound quality and effect eveything is awesome. The only drawback is for people who uses Mac book and try to use airdopes for offical calling apps like skype or teams, it will not work. Everytime it will get disconnected. Whereas song will work fine in MacI mainly bought this for attending office meetings but this is really frustrating that it wont work for the main purpose i bought for"
"Good aesthetics, Power bank is good option.Not great comfort. Connectivity issues sometimes with voice call. Voice call lagging sometimes. Better disable your wifi calling option. Music quality is just ok.Surrounding noise is very disturbing. Suitable product for work from home callers. Can't be used for calling while travelling.Can be used for good look. Not suitable for music lovers who expects great sound quality.Battery backup is simply great."
"The sound quality is great, the bass and noise cancellation are amazing for the price. Even the battery backup is great. Unfortunately, I had to return this cuz my stupid phone has some connectivity issues."
"In the budget segment, Boat Airdopes 441 is probably one of the best products on offer. I am completely satisfied and happy that I chose to buy this one! Comfortable to wear, easy to use, lasting battery, fast charging, finishing, sound quality, call quality, overall, quite a good product, definitely recommended for anyone considering to buy wireless buds."
"Easy to use, perfect fit & wireless ear buds which I can wear for 5+ hours. Thanks to technology and Boats !Initial review is 5/5, I will again review it after two months..but as far as I collected other reviews, perhaps this is best product at such a low price."
"So using this airdops 441 from last 3 days and everything is good, good for high bass lover but only disappointment about this is battery is not lasting upto 5 hours, I am listening song from last 3 hours and the battery is dead now just after 3 hours 20 minutes and it is mention the playback time of up to 5 hours in earbuds, rest everything is fine with this eardops no pain while using no noise, fast charging."
"Not sure if this product is review scammed. It certainly does not deserve the high rating it had when I bought it. The product is very heavy and gives a headache if worn for long. It also pops out if you shake your head. The only saving grace is it's sound quality, which isn't bad. For its price their are a lot of better products out there. Certainly don't recommend it to anyone."
This is a review only after 2 days of usage. The product is an Average product. The Boat airdope 441 pro design wise a good one but the sound clarity is average. The sound is cracking while calling and listening musics. Sometimes the mic also not properly working. The power backup is good in this product. The quality wise the product is good. The noise cancellation is also an average. And the bass is also better. The total review about Boat airdope 441 pro is average and excepting the sound cracking the product is ok for me....
"Although sound quality was good but definitely not worth the money because of disgusting service from boat. Airdopes stopped working after 3 months of usage then company took 2 months to replace it and even the replaced product was damaged. Again it's been nearly two months and I haven't received the second replacement, neither there's any update on the ticket from past 15 days. Totally I'm regretting every penny of price for choosing boat. I'm 1000% sure there are better deals than this in the same price range.Edit: I had to replace the product three times and everytime it was damaged replacement. Finally I gave up and i m using it anyways. Boat is clearly the worst."
"Got it for 1799, I'm so happy to have this airdopes!! I was afraid since I never used boat products but satisfied with the product.Sound quality - Love the bass, good sound quality but while on call the sound quality is okay! Not bad nor amazing.Slim and attractive case, really satisfied with the product.Fit is perfect in my ears but little pain after sometime.Overall perfect on this price point.Cons - as mentioned call quality is averageFitting could been more comfortable."
"The first time when i used, it was good. Then i noticed the noise coming from the left earbud when there is a pause in the music. It clearly dissapoints the immersive experience of noise cancellation. Got a new pair after replacement, which arrived in 2 days. Now the left ear bud functions properly. Its a great piece of earbuds to have it just for 1950/- (festive offer). Some functions like single earbud use is really convenient. Will recommend surely, if found problamatic, go with return and replace and u are good to go."
"Honest review : Very excited to get this product. The sound was good, size was compact yet fit, I didn’t feel it in my ears as it’s light. Overall, I get it was a good pair of earbuds. But after sometime’s use , I understood that the Bluetooth connectivity was really very poor. Can’t keep the phone in the pocket,  can’t keep it even a metre away, so , as the product says, working out with the earbuds is difficult. So this is the only and main problem with this. I don’t feel any other major problem"
"very much disappointed with the device as this is not a MULTIPOINT ( doesn't connect to two devices - my laptop for attending meeting and phone at the same time ) my 13 yrs old 500Rs Bluetooth has this basic function.. nowadays anyone carries more than one gadget. I believe everyone uses a laptop as well as a phone. so do we need to have a separate Bluetooth device for a laptop, one for a phone ?? this device provides advanced functionality like IPX4/6 .good driver bla bla..lack basic functionality of multi-point which 500Rs ..15yrs old Bluetooth having it..now it's not even returnable ..waste of money"
"Pros :1. Good Sound Quality2. battery life is also good3. Good sound quality while in call4. Good grip in the earCons :1. Bass is not as great as expected.2. After a while the ear pains a little bit (Maybe due to my ear shape).3. Having a bit problem while connecting to my pc ( My PC has TP link USB Bluetooth adapter having BT version V4.0). Playing audio or video is ok but during a call, (tested only on Google meet) sometimes the audio cracks, or one of the earpods go mute or the volume rises and falls.Overall good earpods. The price could be a little bit lower. In my case it was Rs. 1999.Writing review on the day of getting delivery. More detailed review coming later."
Review after using this earbud for 25 days now.Initially it was working fine..sound quality was good too. But after 23days..used for around working days it has become useless.  Sound becomed very low and you have to press it with your fingers then only you will hear a faint voice. Total waste of money.  Dont buy.
"In such an amount this product is awesome.The touch sensitivity is high, the bass is a wonder and the reason for this product to get the best sale.- comfortable in the ear but touch part is so sensitive, even a slight  touch which will stop the current playing music/video- Battery backup is ok, as per the commitment it is not so much markable.- This product is only for listening to music if you are purchasing for the call purpose, better check the specs before purchasing."
"I would have said great headphones under budget which checks most of the basic parameters like sound quality, noise cancellation and ergonomics but after using for 4 months the battery only lasts for 1.5 hours max where they have advertised 4.5 hours. I would say people who are looking for good battery life, this earbuds are certainly not one of them."
"Hello guy's,So, I would try to give the genuine review for the pair of TWS.1. Look : The first thing which I would like to highlight is it looks really good and attractive.2. Bass : The bass was really good. Better then my expectations.3. Battery : Battery life is huge.4. Comfort : Believe me I wore it for almost 5 hours but it felt like nothing is there in my ears.5. Sound Quality : This is the most important part which I did not like and that is the reason I gave 1 star. Because at this price I expected a better audio quality but I was disappointed & also I felt the voice is pretty low if I will compare with boat neck bands.That's it guy's. If you do not like high volume buds then maybe this would be the best option for you guy's.All the best."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Amazing product. Only issue is at the time of call another side the person is unable to listen properly.You can charge your phone as well from the earpod case in emergency."
"Please don't purchase this earbuds, I am having a horrible experience with it.!! Please its my humble humble request don't purchase this.I have purchased it 4 weeks ago, & be is not working properly like i usually use in stereo mode , 1 earbud is not having sound infact it showing its connected but doesn't gives the sound.!"
"Pros. Good Connectivity, good call quality,Cons. bass is good till the volume is 60 to 65% but it get terrible if you increase the volume. Sounds like someone is breaking wall from hammer.Fitting is just ok. I was feeling pain after 30 mins of usage."
Airdopes are good at a price range of Rs.:-2500 but not preferable beyond that.Few things I observed while using airdopes1. Don't have noise cancellation. Person speaking to you can easily here background noise which is very disturbing while talking to someone over the call.2. Battery backup is good. Airdopes works up-to 4.5 hours on single charge. Case charging capacity is good.3. Didn't find any latency while playing games. Good voice quality while playing audio or video.4. IWP is really good. Connects instantly once the case is open.5. Not preferable to using in open space for calling purpose. Good for music and other stuffs but not good for calling.
"Bass is real good, but the best part is battery backup on the charging dock. Just charge it once and forget charging it for the week or even more. Rest, no issues at all. By the way, I got these as replacement for the previous ones. There was static noise on the right earpiece. But thanks to the seller and Amazon, got brand new replacement."
"the connectivity is very poor on  webex or zoom call the connection keeps droppingon you tube also same. Some times have to play buds in and out of the case just to connect .calls quality is very poor the opposite person cant hear you clearly , I have to keep my hand as cover while taking on call."
"Hello ,I bought earpods 441pro in October . One of the earpods isn't working .I requested for a product replacement . My nearest service center doesn't provide services for these products. I have called the boat warranty services centers 4 times...each time waited for 20 mints but no one answeredAfter one month of calling multiple times...I still haven't got any solutionReally realy frustrated!!!!!Will never recomend boat to anyone....and I am going to publish is everywhere on my social media coz I am really frustrated with their service"
Writting this review after using 2 months.Product build quality 4.5 out of 5Sound quality 4 out of 5Comfort 4 out of 5Look's 4.5 out of 5Noice cancellation 4.5 out of 5Battery backup 4 out of 5Overall product rating 4 out of 5Is this value for money Yes 4.5 out of 5
"I have gone through the reviews many wrote like  they got some issues with the buds and annoying noise beep sounds but I've gone for this 441 ,boat never disappointed me as I'm using boat headphones and used other models form boat brandAnd as usual I got the perfect pair of airdopes with no defects.I'm a music loverThe sound is very goodThe vocals the instruments the bass everything is very clear , much goodThe bass is 5/5 which many looks for."
It looks compact and fits correctly on our ears. The sound quality and bass effect is good. First airpods to own and very much satisfied with the experience. Worth every penny.
"Have been noticing latency while playing music videos on YouTube. Even though the offset is not that much it sure is noticeable. A simple reboot solves the issue but the problem occur again from time to time.For calls over Internet, this is not good at all! Since day 1 I've been trying to use this for MS Teams or Skype calls with pathetic results.For normal mobile calls these are decent."
the bot air dopes 441 is a good product. Its in a good condition and it sounds good in the volume between 0-75 but when it at the max vol its sounds dissorted and it has a latency issue of 1 sec . but other than that it is good to hear music and other stuff fits well in the ear
"I ordered Boat Airdopes 441 on 15th July 2020. Within use of a month, one of the piece stopped charging, so I wrote a complaint with Boat. After that the airdopes were picked and after a wait of more than a month, today i received the airdopes back from Boat Service Centre. On opening the packet I found that I have received the airdopes of Black colour, whereas the airdopes that I own are of Bumblebee colour. Now i don't know who's used airdopes Boat has sent me. And on top of it, in order to get this corrected I have to again write a complaint with dope and this cycle of 1 and a half month will repeat again.Pathetic product, even worse service. Not recommended at all!!!"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Sound quality, calling quality is not compromised, but the only annoying thing was when I first ordered I received the product with right bud touch sensor issue and placed replacement order and again the next day received the same product with same issue. I think Boat is not performing final checks of its products before packaging."
"Awesome and super awesome product from boAt😍😍.Its amazing product, it is super super marvellous for gaming purpose,call quality is awesome,bass quality is great.All features are mindblowing.Don't think so much just purchase it."
"There is no noise cancellation and it causes a lot of trouble to talk. If you want to run, you want absolutely stable in your ears.  There is no problem and the music is also good.  There is a lot of problem at the time of calling because the outside noise draws towards it.😔"
"Ok let me start with the sound>Sound quality is good but the volume increases drastically as we go from 60-70% to 95%....increase is not consistent so be carefull if your ears are sensitive>Bass , trebble etc are goodConectivity->There was some conectivity issue at first but after first connection it connected without any issueCharging - takes around 1.5hrs to charge....earbuds will last for 3-4 hoursBuilt-Hard plastic , durable....I dnt know if the buds are metal or not but they are pretty strongConfort-YOU CANNOT WEAR THEM FOR MORE THAN AN HOURThey cause pain in the ears if worn for more than 1/2 hrsConclusion-If u gonna use them for exercise or casual listening to music u can definitely go for it....but if u wanna use them for gaming or wear it for long duration , go for something like realme buds"
Facing lots of problems ..one side volume is high... calling is worst..another person not able to see.. replacement period is already expire
"Good product for bass lovers and bike riders (Not to use full volume at driving). Other person can hear voice clearly,  Sound quality is superb.  Only issue is the side rubber around the earbud is sometime hurts ears as. Otherwise everything is good. 🎧*Touch Control is superb.*Voice quality good in calls.*Can use one bud while other bud is charging.*Battery in buds lasts 4- 5 hrs ×4 times carry case charge."
"The bass, sound quality is good but the thing is it doesn't fit in my ear it falls off quite often even if I'm not working out. Tried all the earbuds which came with the box but I'm still very disappointed with the outcome.The sound quality and bass is excellent but if you have big ears like me look for some other option as it will eventually fall off every now and then which is very annoying, the fit and the design itself is very poor."
"Bought at the Great Indian Festival 2020.Pros- Very good sound quality, with crystal clear sound. Has a very good noise cancellation feature. You won't be able to hear the lorry passing by 😜. The bass quality is really awesome not compromising the treble. The battery backup is promising. You can run,jog, exercise still the airdopes will not fall down.Cons- The range of the airdopes is limited to 6-8 metres.Overall a very good product at this price."
one gets a decent deal for acceptable quality. One of the airpods stopped working. unfortunately one can buy online but has to visit service center for any support. so beware of fine prints in warranty while buying boat product online.
"The phones work fine for a while, and then suddenly stop working. I have checked and noted that it happens after about 15-17 minutes of syncing. I have tested this on multiple devices (laptops and cellphones)- with the same result. Yes, they look good. Yes, they sound good. But they fail within 15 minutes. You'll need to put them in that box they give you and practically restart the earphones. It really beats the point of having wireless headphones. I would certainly recommend using wired headphones over wireless ones."
The music and call quality are moderate. Noise cancelling only to the person receiving. Does not cut down the surrounding noise to the other person on call. The design is faulty... the airpodes keep falling off.. even when worn properly. I alread lost mine cause it dropped off was walking!
As The Right Side EarBud is not charging and it's Problem for every boat product I purchased from the site.I want to claim my warrenty as they are giving a year warranty and their products are not working properly in just six months so I want to reply my earpod otherwise I will complaint against the same.There is no noise cancellation and bass quality is good but they will not charge so it replace by the boat company.Otherwise I Will Suggest to amazon please discontinue the sell of boat earpods as they will hamper your quality of products which not durable.
"Would like to give 0.Have raised complaint and chasing customer care for last 3 months, but its like talking to a wall. I never get any response, neither from customer care number nor through emails.Would only recommend this product, if you are interested in use and through product.But if you are really interested in some quality and brand, would request to buy other item. As in boAt, they hardly care for customer. Once the item is sold, that they do not care and its primary your responsibility as you bought boAt."
When i purchased i thot ingot a good product but after using for some months i found it to be worst product..why i say so..bcoz both buds dont pair properly ..after 2 min either of pods/buds loses connection....quality or i say sound is patchy..i hear only in bud most of time.And now i cant even return it.
Awsome Ear Pods by BOAT. Very crisp sound even at high volume. Does not Distort.The Bass is very good. Battery back up is also very good.Perfectly fits into ears. Very easy to Pair. Even call quality is very good. Looks are Premium.
Good in parts.Worse otherwise.You can NOT use this as a headphones with mic. Mic is terrible. The audio isn't noise cancellation.Bass is great but what good is the bass when the product keeps disconnecting and sound comes in patches. Goes blank and reconnects speeding through all the sound lost.And this is when you are not even arm's length from the phone.Very frustrating. Wish I could get a refund.
I recently bought boat 441pro from amazon saleI have some issues with my product.....I will mention every issue so that you may know about it1.left earphone keeps disconnecting but not the right one if I just move away from the mobile2.there is some sharp static noise in the left one3.while I was in a zoom conference I placed a earpod back in the case ....of a sudden the sound was coming from my mobile even when the right pod is connected4.sound suddenly stops even  when connected to my laptop(Alienware 15r4).Note:Even gone through the instruction manual for a solution but none could help....I even rebooted my pods but it was useless.....
"Using this product for the last 5 months, and I'm really satisfied with it. I am very much habituated with using over thr head headphones so i was cynicall at the first about its bass and sound quality.. But oh god! it blew my mind away. Battery service is as good as promisedOne can go for it in this price range without any second thoughts.Happy listening!"
This product shouldn't be allowed to put on sale. Ot hasn't been tested properly. I have ordered and replaced twoce and the right earphone has a static noise when no music is playing. It's very noticeable and very distracting. The pairing is horrible. The latency is too much. It's just a terrible product. This was my first boat product and will probably be my last.
"I am writing this review after using this product for almost 6 months now. This product is not working anymore and now i have to travel 35kms to get it fixed. It is a pain in the neck to connect to Amazon customer and get the correct support.Issues in early stages were too long for charging, painful process of connecting both the ear pieces to Bluetooth and then poor call quality."
"Sound and bass quality of the EarPods is not good at all. It does not fit good in ears too. Even on medium volume music play it leaks sound and others at 5 m distance can also  hear it.Only good thing About this is battery capacity, it remains charge for weeks if you usse an hour per day.Also the power bank option is amazing, you can charge your phone fully with it."
"Given the price, this pair is solid in terms of build quality, sound quality, very clean bass quality, minor distortions at 100% volume,  connectivity and also very thought out miscellaneous features such as touch controls aand water resistance. Decent battery life. Only once or twice in my whole usage time with it there were very minor connection drops. But overall the best product with respect to the price."
"It's quick, good and smooth. Sound quality is good, you get nice bass too. Touch control is just so cool. Battery life yet to be checked. But overall good for price range. Cannot expect noise cancellation in this price range. So we can live with that."
Only colour looks good other then else all features are false I bought with in a day one single airpod stoped working I got exchanged but same problem with other new airpods. I have take refund.
Overall sound quality does not disappoint at all.However 1. The ear buds are not ergonomically designed and there is always a fear that they may get dislodged2. The touch points on the pods are pathetic. Sometimes they respond but mostly they don't.I was very dissatisfied with this product from boat since my earlier purchases were very satisfactory.
"I using eardopes nearly one month  , but now I can't use this for calling.. I can't hear nothing if I make call when bluethooth connected to boat eardopes. Please help for solution. For Other uses this is working fine. I caused this difficulty Only when calling.If we put it on loud or phone speaker while icalling I can hear properly.."""
"Mic is not working now and it's not even 1 year. Buds don't work over a call, over a call neither speaker nor mic of this airdopes works.  Now It works only on media apps like YouTube n music apps but mic is gone.  .. How to avail warranty?Quality is good, fitting is good, design is good.. but after using for 3 hrs. Continuously there was a mild pain but only in the last hr after that nothing. There is the lag in sound. The audio is always a fraction of second delayed i noticed when i played pubg and used musical apps. Maybe it's the technological problem with all bluetooth speakers n earphones."
"Although sound quality is decent. However the build quality is pathetic - I have replaced these twice since buying in 2 months (June 2021). The pods randomly won't pair, charge.Waste of money. The service center was filled with customers like me. Won't use this anymore  buying another quality brand"
nice..... but it not going to stand well on your ears for long time and  The touch sensitivity is fully sensitivite when you going to adjust you Earphones 🎧 that gonna end a call or stop a song. in my case my ears are paining thats mosly my problem(may be)
"This is a worst product mic stop working after 2 months with computer. Now return window also closed in 19 July..2021. I bought this product in 12 july 2021. Not sure how to use the 1 year warranty to replace or return this product. Please don’t buy, absolutely not recommend"
Its a beast airdopes and the battery life is amazing It stays upto 3 to 4 day and you can the feel the music and the bass quality to hear it for gaming it little bit delay.For listen only musics you must buy the Boat Airdopes 441. It was my best experience in the musics it is better than the JBL air buds. I recommend to buy this their is no issue at all. It is a beast Airdopes 441
"I got a deal and bought it at 1900/-. Amazing sound. Battery backup is good, lasts around 10 days with 2hrs daily usage in gym. Its a looker, amazing color and looks. Looks very premium and sporty. Noise cancellation could be better. Bass and treble are good"
I liked that the product had jnsane battery backup. You don't usually even have to think about charging this pair of earphones.But the problem is that the earphones are extremely uncomfortable. The wing tips really dig into your ear and starts hurting after an hour or so of use. You cannot properly use it without the wing tips since the earphones might fall out of your ear.
"Bass is goodInbuilt volume is bit low compared to othersNot so good for calls as person at other end can't hear clear and you have to speak louder.Good for listening music, only volume is bit low and noise cancellation not very good."
"The model airdopes 441 is totally trash. When I got the product, it was a total nightmare. The product was not charging, battery backup of the ear buds was less than an hour. So I got a replacement for this and I must say the product was made in a hurry. The replacement eardopes were producing a static noise and the charging case’s backup was approximately 7 hours, which was far less than the mentioned 25 hrs. I’m saddened to say, as I’m a regular customer of Amazon but never expected this kind of service till now."
"Call quality is not good, jab aap kisi se baat krte hai to unko lgta hai k aapki aawaz kafi kam hai jaise ki phone se dur hokar baat kar rahe ho.Bass b thik thak hia but sound me quality nahi haiConnectivity is also goodOverall calling quality is poor rest is good in this price segment"
"Great sound.Great fit bit uncomfortable after an hour or two but tolrable.Great build.Good case with magnet so no accidental fall.Both eqrfones have there own touch control and moc, so one can use just one earfone at a time for call or music.Just one issue or con i.e. Battery backup is quite less only 3 hours per full charging."
These earbuds have given me trouble since day 1. Typically one earbud doesn’t work. I have tried factory reset as well but it still doesn’t work. Plus getting in touch with the service center is a nightmare. Not worth the headache. I have barely used it because there is some problem or the other. It doesn’t easily connect to the laptop either. Not worth it.
For all the buyers out there please take a good note.This airdopes are pretty good in term of sound quality performance and bassThere is a little bit of latency and I don't recommend it for gaming.But one thing  that so horrible for it is the mic. Well at first I thought I got a defective product but soon realised most people are facing the same issue. But many don't know it yet as most boat user love it for its sound quality and that is something you can love. But I can tell you one thing that it is not for calls period.
"One side airdope stopped working within 15 days, then later these airdopes were not able to detect in Bluetooth section if phone..when i raised ticket for replacement then it took more than 1 month to get replacement,And the worst part it, they sent me other model airdopes 311v2 which was the older model and cheaper than airdopes 441.The customer support is pathetic, it is practically impossible to connect with them on call , i tried more than 50 times but unable to have words with thr customer support.I suggest dont buy it at all..this is not a standard process driven company."
"Nice tws at this price.ProsGood battery backup,Nice audio output,Negligible lag in audio during videos and music,Nice fit to ears and nice design.ConsNot fit for gaming,since there is no low latency you will be noticing lag during gaming,I have faced lag in audio while playing pubg.so not recommended for gaming.Average noise cancellation,Very few times you may face some connectivity issues, but not a major problem it can be simply solved by factory reset.Finally it's good at this price but you can look at boulton tws at same price with low latency."
"Past 3 years I've been using this and this is one of the best one i had period. The bass got me addicted that I have a ""nothing ear1"" but I go for this one only for bass. I have thrown this sometimes and also it accidentally fell, but it remains to entertain me even now. I have some battery issues after 3 years. One ear piece is running out of juice within 30 mins of play. This is the best it can do and it built my trust around the brand. Good work team boat💪"
"Earphones are really good but don't expect noise cancellation at this price range. But due to amazing fit of the buds in the ear, the outside noise is cut by 60%. So, we have an amazing hearing experience here. Beats are clear.Call quality is poor but it's better if we avoid calling in these buds unless there is a calm environment. In noisy environment the other person cannot here your voice.Ultimately for music and classes purposes it's really good and battery is also lasts long enough(around 28-30 hrs with case, 4-5 hrs per bud)."
The main reason someone will buy this is the battery life promised. But let me tell uh battery life is not long as described. Uh will get a max 10-15 time charge in the case after that case will discharge. I already claimed warrenty and got a replacement order from boat but the charging issue was same. Rest the sound and bass is very good. But microphone is poor for calling as I am experiencing this.
"Simply Superb. Really good ear buds with great sound quality and for the price that it is being offered on amazon, its a steal deal."
.... ALWAYS BEING A BOAT FAN.....Just go for it.... Don't think much......BASS: superb... in its best....BATTERY: really good.... Case being a power bank itself is a best thing I foundLOOK: premium really.....and it's lights make it extra premiumSOUND: awesome...
"The sound quality and bass quality of the product is average. The issue is with the product built/quality. The product started malfunctioning (the left ear bud wasn’t charging) after two months of purchase. Got it replaced. Now on the 13th month of purchase, the entire case is not charging. The service centres are also too far and few. Boat had started with door to door pickup and drop service. They have pulled it back.Seriously disappointed with the service and product built."
"I ordered them in the Amazon sale and got them for a very good price, sound is good, so is the bass. I mean for the prices it could have been the best buy in this segment but the battery for me was very very bad. It drained out from 100 to 50% in just 30 minutes of music usage on 70% volume. Not acceptable when the manufacturer claims 5 hours of backup. Also the left ear bud started heating up during the usage. Build quality and everything else is fine but the major selling point for this product is battery backup and if the buds cannot even have 3 hours of battery life on a single charge then no point in having a charging case providing 150 hours of backup.I returned them and got the refund pretty quickly, not worth the time and effort."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Initially it was working well, but after 3 months left ear piece started malfunctioning, now after 6 months right ear piece also has connectivity issue. Sound quality ok but catching background noise heavily, bass is mid."
"NOT RECOMMENDED. Works good but only as a headphone for music (laptop as well phone), not at all good for hands free mode i.e. calls and meetings either with phone or laptop etc, people on other side not able to hear properly, very feeble audio for them. No dual pairing or connectivity, meaning cannot have it connected with laptop and phone simultaneously, disconnect from one to use with other."
"I recieved my product on 20 Jun 2020 and I was working fine, until after 15 days, started giving me mic issues and connectivity issues and I asked the company for a warranty service. They picked my product on 16 July 2020, and I was eagerly waiting for the product to be delievered and today its been 31 days since I got any update for my product. The company said it would take just 4-5 days to repair them but its been a month with no contact with the company. I tried every email, every contact number provided by the company and I am getting no response or leads.Really bad service."
"First let's talk about package. It was really well packed with bubble wrap, boat seal with upper plastic wrap. It's completely brand new product. The charge was 100% when I received this product. It's super fit and light in weight. Audio quality 5/5. Crystal clean sound. I came across many review saying that it has 'hiss' or 'grr' sound luckily I have none of such flaws. It's just flawless. Media audio is just op. Call quality is average. Go for it blindly. Thank you amazon for delivering a flawless product."
"BELOW AVERAGE PRODUCT!!!!!!! Don't buy this product, my airdopes stopped working immediate after next day of replace eligible day.Regarding warrenty , unplaced my complaint 10 days back still no response from boat company, none have showed up for replacement. Battery life is worst of all. Got itself drained after 15-20min of playing time"
"I ve been using boat aidopes 441 for past 10 days.Overall sound quality seems to be okay with me. And the charging case quality seems to be a little cheap.Comming straight to the problem, my right eardope isn't charging properly from the case.. sometimes i need to press on right earbud after placing inside th case.. Left eardope is 100 % charged and right one only 10 % . I placed both eardopes inside the case on the same time..I requested for a replacement and vl update the review and rating after the replacement.Edit : replacement also shown same problem after 1 month of usage.. my money gone:("
The product was really awsome and the sound quality was too good at this price but little bit issue of battery as per my side because in watching web series and all for 5-6 hours this will not helpful so boat can make a change to give battery backup of 7-8 hrs at least . But at the end I will say that product is worth of it's price. ❤🔥
"It's been almost a month using the airpods ,I would say overall the quality of the product is excellent but not wow.I would give 8 out of 10, as they keep falling, I have to very careful everytime I wear themselves  I cant be carefree. Other than this I guess JBL has a better bass than Boat . I wouldnt say it was bad but I would also not say it was wow."
I Recommend you purchase the product. It gives you the best sound Quality and Noice cancellation around us. I like it's base Sound Quality and Performance. Best reliable Price. First thing that I have opened the Air pods and I have been checked for the confirmation about it's quality. And I have been noticed that one airpod gets stop working for the first time and I felt so bad. I tried as many times. Later the problem get solved and then later the Air pods have worked in the everlast performance.
"Very attractive airdopes , sound quality is Good ,bass lovers can enjoy this product , vocals are clear call quality is above average , power bank support is also NYC"
"Bought them for 1999/- on amazon sale.Build quality is okay.Both my ear-buds works fine.There is no lag in pairing with each other and the phone.Sound quality is alsol good.I saw a lot of people complaining about the mic, however the mic is fine. I have used them for a lot of zoom calls and google meetings. Everyone can hear me fine.I took one star for the build quality. It's not flimsy but it could've been better."
All the product of this company are imported from China. Initially its product was a little good. Now this company sell very low quality products. And cheat to customers. Once delivered then boAt company and Amazon do not refund. Hence do not bye boAt at all. Believe in me. I replaced so many its item but all are not working. Its noise reduction feature is rubbish.  It doesn't work.
"Not made for Calling. it is good for music,gym and also for running purpose but if you want to call then you have to speak loudly.Also if you use earphone more than 4-5 hour a day than charging buds can also feel you pathetic.so, if you only want to use it for specific purpose than its ok otherwise for me i use earphone 10 hr a day its not much purposeful."
"Review after 6 months. Good for bass lovers. Notice cancellation is also good. Build quality is nice. Aftur full charge it can work 3 hours continuously. While using Microsoft teams,discord,Google meet the sound gets interrupted frequently. Finally it's good for listening music and watching movies and youtube."
"Great product everything is super solid ""sound quality"", ""noise cancellation"" and ""bass quality"" works very well. Only thing i didnt like is size in ears is big soo you cant put it much longer in your ears it will pain."
"If you keep the device out of its charging box and your mobile is not connected to it, anyone within the bluetooth radius can connect to the device. They can even start the voice recorder on their PC and thus can eavesdrop on your conversation. This is a serious security flaw where anyone can connect to it without any password."
"I bought this product to gift my son (studing in std.7), as Diwali gift I received it well in advance. the quality and the build of the product is best. Sound quality is amezing. Even a std.7 boy can operate it eaisly. I would recommend the buyers to go for it.."
Its not better than boat headphone.Bass was not too effective.Most important thing is feeling while listening songAirdopes fail to my expectation.Some features are missing like:1) Volume adjustment feature missing2) Sensor where working slow.I am not saying product is badJust in cheap price there is more effectiveProduct i can buy.Can't fulfill my expectation.
"Just one word ' ULTIMATE 'Awesome soundAwesome battery backupAwesome build qualityJust go for this pair 😉Don't get confused with negative reviews(After one month)While washing my mouth, it suddenly dropped into water and dip in water completely. I immediately removed from water but shocked to see , it was still working right (WOW) . Friends, just go for it."
"Overall sound quality is above average. I think too much bass.Note: the Voice call quality is poor. I think the problem lies in the mic of the headset. The person on the other end of the call is complaining about the poor voice quality like echoing voice, or muffled voice. I've myself tried letting other person speak through it and found poor quality in call voice.My review: It's okay for entertainment purpose but not that good for calls. Okay for gaming( not that low latency but little lower than other tws headsets. A little delay in sound after the action can be seen)."
"Bought the boAt Airdopes 441 TWS Ear-Buds with IWP Technology, Immersive Audio, Up to 30H Total Playback, IPX7 Water Resistance, Super Touch Controls, Secure Sports Fit & Type-C Port(Spirit Lime) on 7th August 2020. One among the pairs, isnt working (infact not getting charged). Suggest how to replace...its been difficult as customer service response isnt great"
"I use this for multiple products, and the fit is great. Just be sure to treat the plastic ear hooks gently, mine tore a little, but are still perfectly functional. Doesn't fall out while intense running or exercise, and the controls work perfectly."
"I have purchased this product recently, but facing issues with it from the first day.Noise cancellation won't work.  They have not promised that it will work, but while speaking through the ear pods, other noises will be added and they are too loud.  Also, the person's voice is not clear in calls.Very sensitive - if speaking on call we touch the product, either the call will be disconnected or it will be muted.Overall, I'm not happy with this product. Purchased it because of the brand, but not worth it."
"I just want to mention if someone is facing the error where you are able to use it for music but unable to use for calling purpose even after all the troubleshooting. Then please restart your mobile once. I reviewed this product with very less rating but now changing my ratings as the problem is resolved. Very good sound quality, bass is very decent, calling quality is superb. Very much balanced sound quality. Great product. Good job team Boat. Keep it up. Now I'm thinking to purchase Boat Rockerz as well."
I have to always remove the earphones during a call since the users complain of muffled voice.Connecting with laptop is always an issue. Hangout/Zoom on Laptop is not very seamless.Earphones hurt ear even after 15-20min of use. My previous earbuds (Muzili) were way better in terms of comfort
Guys first of all i want to use only made in india ..had lot of chinese options but i still trusted indian brand ..Bit uncomfortable..with ear loops for me i guess not used to ..after sometime.starts hurting ur ears ..overall with price range ..good value for money..i think best value for money..treble slightly on lower side but bass is amazing..u will enjoy it ..buy indian and only indianplease
Everything is good but unfortunately is stopped working intermittently . Need to factory rest every use. The all accessories also returned please see the picture. Thank You.
"Such a great product in this price range. It is probably the best tws airbuds in this range. Sound quality is too good , base is balanced , though noice cancellation is not so prominent. The design is so compact and charming. Earbuds are also comfortable to wear for a long time. One thing which I would like to suggest is to add the volume controller in the buds.Otherwise , it's a great product. Highly recommended for this price."
"Nice Packing..Its Brand New Box I open It ..Product is Awesome Lightweight ..I love It , This Is My First TWS ..I will Share Actual Feedback After One Month But Product Is Awesome Feels Good Quality Material used ..Boat Works It On Awesomely ..Sound Quality Is Nice Like Another Boat Wired Earphones..Great Sound Quality Also Noise Cancellation is work Properly..Best For Calling and Songs ..Bass Quality Is Best"
It is the most horrible Product I’ve ever bought on Amazon I have complained and I was replaced with another headphone piece but that also had turned out to be defective I still can’t understand why can’t you people return my money back so that I can buy something better gadget for my wireless headphones boat turn out to be a bad experience and I would really really can you request you people to kindly return my money or allow me to buy something different wireless headphone of the same price which has got a better quality sound.
"Poor battery life making it difficult to use them over a long time or range. Hardly any options to toggle with bass or treble. Easy on the ears, though. Good design. Easily charged. Loe battery time almost makes me wish i had bought good quality wired earphones that don't need charging and Bluetooth.I would recommend good wired earphones over these ones."
"The Quality of Airdopes mic is so much pathetic that the persone talking to you from other side wont even able to listen your voice properly, what they can listen is only the background sound.. after repeating 3 to 4 time may be the guy talking to can manage to understand what you r talking about.. this airdopes are very much frustreting that on every call u will have fill like to throw it out.i personally suggest not to buy this product..speaker n sound quality is good but for callers it wint help u guy.. mic is like hell"
"I am using this headphone for about 6 months and it was working well. But left earpod had charging issue all of a sudden and contacted BoAt support about this. The support was immediate and they picked the faulty unit and replaced with new one within a week. This is exceptional support from BoAt.Apart from this service, the earpods are also working good. I mainly use this while jogging and it fits well in the ear. For my 1 1/2 hour workout this is perfect pair of earpods."
I order thos product boat 441..which is really outstanding..may be people giving negetive feedback..may be they dontknow how to adjust equalizer.So dont go for negetive reviews...I can say this product can compare to bose...im a bose user...but boat won my heart in sound and bass quality..ant tap system in this product is awsome.
Left side was not charging and blinking red as i was tapping on that left airdope. I tried everything to make it working but it doesn't wanna come to life. Sound quality is also not good. I connected it to my android and iphone but bass tottaly covers trebble as you will increase volume over 75%. If you want them for music then don't go for them.
"Good Sound.Good Bass.Good if you want for gaming and music, at this price range.Do not buy earbuds for calls. You will just be disappointed.The mic is far away from your mouth and it catches on almost all background noise.The calling experience was very bad. Otherwise a good purchase."
"I have been using this for a week now for my regular cycling.- Fits best in my ears- Sound quality is superb - way better than I had Zebronics overhead headphones- Touch is not effective. It works sometimes and sometimes not. There is a delay in touch as well when it works- Battery life is so far good. I have used it for a week without charging for a week i.e. I have not put the case into charging since I received and yet, they are working fine... (do note that, I am not using the earbuds more than hour a day)"
-Bettery drains so quickly that you can't use it for along time It went to 20% after normal use.-It disconncts automatically- I bought them thinking the BOAT rokerz Experience but it's nowhere.- the fin hearts ear after an hour of use- go for some other Brand I paid 2499 but it's not worth of it.
There is no return policy. Total Money wastage. Product quality is very bad. Made in china item. Cheap product. The product is forced on customer as there’s no return policy

 It bluetooth connectivity is not great keeps disconnecting and reconnecting, need to reset very frequently. Don't liked it much."
"firstly Build quality is awesome, while I'm in driving these airdopes fall from my hands but still work with same quality. it happenes 2 times to me. and i already used Boat bluetooth wired earphones and from then i like boat earphones for bass and with the same hope now i ordered these. As expected the bass quality and sound is superb and for calls, noise cancellation is OK and good fit into ears. I bought for 2K, at this price these airdopes are good choice."
"These are the worst bluetooth earbuds i ever used. No return policy is there so bought it and now not able to return it. Its connectivity only god know how anyone can connect these with a new device. If one earbud attached other one detached and so on. And even i bought it last month , in its case sometimes buds charged sometimes its not. Trust me , dont fall for the made in india trap, its ur money. Spend it wisely or you will gonna be regret like me"
I buy this boAt Airdopes 441 Bluetooth Truly Wireless in Ear Earbuds with Mic (Sporty Blue) this is my second attempt to buy the airdrops but seriously this is the first time ever I feel don't recommend to buy things online worst experience the first time I buy 2 airdrops for me and my brother one is properly working 2 one is black not working properly that why i order blue color maybe the product is good still not properly working airdrops i got  very worst experience I had
*My honest opinion*Pros:-* perfect bass* cristal clear sound* instant wake and pair technology (better than any other you can find in this price point)* super portable* made with decent plastic not feels cheap* sporty lookCons:-¿¿What do you want more than this in such a low price point??If you read till here than you should buy itbecause its a perfect deal.
"1. Good sound quality if you want to watch movies or listen songs2. Noise cancellation is poor as other person on call can hear a lot of background noises and can't really hear what the actual person wants to say3. Battery life deteriorates very quickly. after 6 months, my earbuds started to discharge within 2 hours. earlier i used to use it at least for 5-6 hours before putting it back to the case."
Worth the money.Noice cancalation is bad. As it's ear pod can't expect more. For the money ur paying. Back up is also good.Bought it for 1999. So all plus points only.Over all worth it go for it and support Indian manufacturers.
"After seeing good reviews on YouTube and Amazon I bought this airdope but honestly it is not worthy to buy at Rs.2799.The worse part is, if I touch the airdope by mistake, the call gets disconnected or the music gets change. The sound quality is also not upto the mark. As per my experience it is not a valuable Airdope."
"Such nice product. Value for money. They are cheaper and yet they are of good quality. One problem is when you attend a call, the sound is not at all clear."
It did not connect with any device on day one even after charging fullyThen one of the earbud start working.And when second started to work first one stopped giving it's service.When both started then I think ok now I don't have to return it .But now comes to know about knew issue that it is not working for call even after enabling it from setting .I can't able to hear other persons talk but he was able to listen me.But it sounds good in case of music and it will be ok with me if it work properly.

"An important point is that these airdopes (or any other bluetooth based headphones) have a serious lag when it comes to gaming. So if you're looking to play COD mobile or any other FPS games with airdopes, please don't purchase them. For videos and songs the audio is very impressive. Overall I'm quite satisfied with this purchase."
"I bought this airport on July 2020, Right side piece stop working in April 2021, Its has been only 10 months gone, very disappointed, But I registered complaint for replacement in Boat Lifestyle website,  I got my replacement after 2 months, They took the defective product from my home and delivered new product to my home. Let see, how long it will work perfectly."
"I'm writing this review after 8 days of usageI brought this for a offer price of ₹2000For the price the quality is good , you wont feal cheap , comparing with realme and redmi buds , this have good build quality and design for price , red accent with black is so attractive , I'll give 4.5 out of 5 for the design and build quality for the priceRegarding the sound quality , which is the most important part , for me the sound is good , its a bit bass boosted ,as you should expect from boat products , due to the boosted bass the midtones vocals are a bit low ,its not too bad , pretty good , so I'll give 3.9 for the sound quality out of 5Next is the battery backup , i get upto 3hr+ battery backup at 85-90 perc volume , and charging case can charge it upto 20+ hrNext is the fit and comfort ,which is i most liked about this product , it will never fall out of the ear ,well locked ,it has 2 size of wings and 3 different soze of ear plugs in pakage ,I have used this in different conditions like indoor and outdoor , inside helmet , the noise cancellation is good , especially its a in ear so noises will automatically cancelled out , using inside helmet is okay but , if u use both earbud you will not hear anything outside which is so danger ,so beware of itNow to con section ,1. there is slight creepy sound coming from left earbud when pause the music and it will hold for 3 sec and stops the noise , it will not notice if u do any activity or something ,its slight noise so its negligible , so i doesn't return the product 2. As i said the bass is a bit more , but some people does like itFor the price i bought it is absolutely a good product , it also has usb type c charging , ipx7 rating , extra ear tips and wings"
Perfect for the price .... The noise cancellation is actually really effective..and the bass is good when you take the size in perspective...when compared to the size the bass is really powerful...  The sound quality is good too!!!..Overall a worth it buy!
"*Sound is very clear..though the bass is low*Bluetooth connectivity is good and works well with all devices*Connectivity during the voice calls works fine though sometimes, the video calls gets disconnected*Perfect fit on the ears and the buds doesn't fall when you move"
"I would say if you want wireless bluetooth earbud headphones for music or meetings in 2500/- to 3000/- budget then buy it with CLOSED EYES, without any further research. You can't get matched quality in this range with any other brand.... Awesome sound, awesome bass, awesome clarity, awesome battery, awsesom features.... Everything awsesom !!!!! :-)"
"I am writing this review after using two airdopes, 201 and 441 for nearly one year. The gist is, do not buy boat airdopes. They just run for 7-8 months and then one of the pods stop working. Both pods suffered similar fate. You can get a replacement if within warranty, but that’s not an exercise for bad quality. The product itself works fine, as long as it works."
The product doesnt work only. I wanted to use it for calls but once connected there is a jarring noise in the background and you cannot hear anyone. I have tried to reset this product and tried every thing but doesnt work only. I thought the problem was with my air dopes and hence requested an exchange. The new ones i got are also exactly the same. Doesnt work only. I used boats products earlier and hence got this assuming this will also be good. But this time its terrible. This is really really bad.
"I bought these for 1999.Used the airdopes 441 for about 6 weeks now. These are worth for the price range. The sound quality is decent...good bass for those who prefer it. Touch controls works fine so far. The case is compact and of decent quality. The hinge however did get a bit wobbly in few weeks of use.Battery is more than sufficient for short to medium usage. Fitting seems fine for me. There is, though, some pain after long use(about 2-3 hours). (Rarely) There are times when there is a short glitch in the feed of either right, left or both buds.Other than these the product is good to use.If you are trying for earbuds, this is a good option in the price range."
"This looks very attractive. Crazy design, look and feel.This is good only for listening to music. Not useful for paring with phone or laptops as volume cannot be controlled especially if u are away from phone or laptop. Microphone quality isn't greatAlso once you put it on to ears, u can not hear anything outside. I felt this is risky."
"So first of all the earphones look really dope built quality is fine.. Sound quality is crisp.offers more than enough bass for a 2.5k price headphone doesnt have any noise cancelling function but the does offer a tight fit in the ear so.. Ya.. Won't be hearing alot of outside noise. And.. But there is one drawback. It has super high latency yes not low high. As a result terrible for gaming like it has almost a full second lag while gaming. So not for gaming.. But if u are looking for an earphone for like jogging, gym, watching movies or simply listening to music go for it its the best available at such a price value for money"
"The sound quality was good while it lasted (5 months)The balance of the volume between both sides had been taken for a toss...The right side was now permanently louder than the left and because of that, the right side's battery runs out before the left side...The left side earbud is now permanently locked at 5% max volume"
Sound and bass quality is good. The product is last long after a full charge. But only thing dissapoints me about the product is its case which feels very cheap and the charging part of the case is not that great. My buds doesnt fit well when I take back them in the case to charge. I have to adjust its position to charge them.
I have been using them for over 4 months. Sound quality is good and all. Main issue is sometimes devices cannot connect to them and then I have to just reset them by putting them back in the box and doing that 3-4 taps. Also sometimes only one ear piece connects and the other one doesn't. Again have to put them back into the box. This happens more often than you would expect.
"The earbuds are great: sound quality is more or less good, battery life is good and connectivity is great as well. However, there is just one small problem that is whenever I turn the earbuds on, every phone nearby which has bluetooth turned on gets are connect option pop up, and so any unknown device connects with it without consent sometimes. Rest assured, it is great. I recommend you to buy these earbuds."
"Sound quality is Average, the airdopes are not very comfortable, after wearing just for more than an hour, you start experiencing pain in the ear, may due to poor fit .... Not suitable for Half marathon / other sports, they will run out fast.....Good for casual use.... But then the price is not justified for a casual.one...."
This is a very substandard product. If you buy it and talk in your ear for ten minutes then it is very hot.This is a very bad product when comparing as their own other product. Please think twice before purchasing.

 Sound quality is awesome but there is no noise cancellation in this. Battery is ok... Not too good once you charge it to 100% it lasts around 3-4hrs depnding on usage. I could watch one movie with full charge. The case can be used to charge the buds for 3times. Overall it is fine but there is no noise cancellation for which i gave only 4stars"
"The product is neither sweat nor water proof the way it claims. Used it only 5-6 times and only once during running. Now,  both earbuds r neither getting charged nor getting started. For warranty claims also, physical visit to service centre is mandatory which is costly and time consuming in city like Mumbai. Not to buy this if u r looking for something to war during workout"
"After charging for 3 hours the item has started to work like a power bank. The product needs some time to get used to and after this it becomes convenient to use.I request the manufacturer to release a video which shows how the restrains on the ear pods have to be used.If not used properly can cause pain. Since i figured this one out the problem is rectified. If there is a manufacturer recommended way to wear them comfortably,it should be shared."
"I ordered this product to give ""Karwachauth"" gift for my wife. But unfortunately I recieve defective product where one Right side ear bud was completely not working.I have noticed similar type of problem in other purchaser comments but still I tried and now I understood others were also right.However, Amazon got full marks for their service but sellers looks not selling genuine original products"
"Using it more than 3 months and writing this review,  good connectivity.  For calls descent (3.5/5)  audio (4.5/5)  bass (4.5/5) .  Very nice product,  loving it.Cons:While continuous usage slight ear pain is there."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It’s looking very cool. But....Performance: Sound is #not satisfactory, #no base , and Mic is not  able to take Low voice . Some time it’s not clear to hear.  Its Made in Chaina (PRC)"
"First of all, you will not get better sound quality than this product in this price range. These are so far the best buds i think have impressed me with the bass, sound quality in music or calls, touch response is amazing. you can use any single piece too if you want.Great battery life and I'm using for two days and it's still not dead yet. Go for it without a thought."
"I bought realme wired earphones for 600 and they sound better than these. The airdopes have too high bass which is not apt at all and it also demeans the treble qualities of anything that is being played. I wanted to return these and get a refund but i guess the company knows that people won't like them so I'm not even getting any return option and to compensate this, they've just given a replacement option. Buy realme wired ones for 600, they're much better than these."
"Found it too cool, as being my 2nd ear buds I am totally satisfied with the product... the 1st 1 is Skullcandy Indy...boAt has made indian market believe in them and gaining the same.. audio quality is chilling, fits with no tension to keep them in ear, loudness is maintained n about bass so keep remember its boAt😊👍🏼 Love it, got for it with no worries"
This was a great product till the return window was open. Now the right one is not working at all. Both don't charge equally. It's really frustrating.Sound is ok otherwise and they don't fall off at all.I would like a refund please.
"Talking experience is very bad...people in other side cant hear you properly, specially if you are outside. So if you want to buy it for speaking purpose its not good. For listening music it is good and fit in ear is also good, noise cancellation is very bad. One more thing if you wear both buds you cant hear if someone talking you (not in phone). Battery is good you can use it for long time without charging. Power bank is just not working...it will not charge while talking and without talking hardly charge 20-30%. Power bank is totally failed."
Basic function missing volume comtrol. If i am using handsfree that means i dnt have my phone in my hand.. so why wd i have to control volume in mobile. You could have given long tap to control volume and 3tap to voice assistant
"Captures too much of environment noise, the person on call will not hear our voice at all.Do not buy if you are looking to make phone calls with this"
It worked good for a few months and now my left airdope runs out of charge for like.. every 5 mins... It's really irritating and the whole point of 5 hours of use for every charge is a scam... It worked only 2 hours and then started giving the battery low warning... And since a months... The situation is bad.. I can use the right bud for calls but cannot do the same for movies.. and left bud is completely irritating.. better go for another one.Sound quality is awesome.. but if the battery is bad... The quality is of no use.Boat airdopes 441 pro.. bad choice
"Earlier i bought jbl earbuds , I wasn't happy with bass quality but these boat earbuds is just awesome .Basshead will defiantly like this .No problem in running / excercise , fit perfectly in ears.Sound -4.5/5Bass- 4.5/5Build quality - 4/5Light Weight -5/5Connectivity -5/5"
"Left ear bud makes buzz sound and its annoying to use. On top of that, amazon could deliver to home but they denied to take return from home and asked me to go out to print and then go to post office to post it. Sad part is, if I don't want this to repeat and cancel the order it's not possible and I will get only replaced product. What if it is bad too ? I will have to go out again to do all this stuff ?I have also read a few reviews which mentioned that a few products have this defect of buzz in left ear bud. So maybe it is quite possible that you might get defect product, so make sure at least you can have return pickup from home if you choose to buy."
"i bought it in 1800 and i loved it .. it has been 3 months .. it is great ... sound quality - good , battery - u can use 3-4 days regularly after full charging. noise cancelation - not like wired earphones but u can manage, bass- medium. color- i ordered mint  and it is wonderful."
"This has been the worst purchase of boat product for me. The second pair that I bought along with this had the same issues. After two replacement I returned that pair as it was good for nothing. The left earpiece of the first pair I bought, after 1 week was not working and couple weeks later both the earpiece were not working. Noise cancellation was worst kind. You could hear background noises completely. Bought this is India and now I'm in UK and can't even order for a replacement for this pair. Rs.2.5k went down the drain entirely. Kindly look for some other pair. Not recommended."
"Terrible bass, muffled sound, it's so bad that it just vibrates without making any sound when in bass. Only good with treble and higher frequencies. There isn't any noise cancellation btw, the sound quality is quite bad compared to years of using headphones. The device is meant to be worn for hours apon end, but it isn't comfortable to wear it and starts to hurt your ears."
"I ordered boAt Airdopes 441 TWS Ear-Buds on 09-Dec-2020. Got my order on 11-Dec-2020. 5 stars for delivery and packaging.I'm writing the review of 2 different products, first one is the original and second is the copy of product which I got in a replacement.I replaced my product coz I'm getting a static noise in left ear bud and got my replacement today means 13-Dec-2020. And when I opened the package (Packaging was best for both the deliveries) I suspect that box is lightweight as compare to previous box and the company's original packaging is not there.Then I opened the box, inside the box following items are there (Replacement product which I received today, first product contains all the accessories which is mentioned in product description) :1. Charging Case (micro-USB supported)2. Earbuds3. Warranty Card4. User Manual5. Charging cable (micro-USB)NO EXTRA EARGRIPS AS MENTIONED IN PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.Second thing was the earbuds are not original as you can see in image belowAlso the charger is micro USB instead of type-C charger.Also the lablel of PRC and related information was not there at below the charging case (Image provided)And I ordered a Spirit Lime color, the charging case is of spirit lime but inside the case it's yellow and the earbuds are also yellow.Completely disappointed from Amazon services this time...never expected this.I'm guessing the product I received is also a replacement product coz of the tape marks which is present on the box that completely means Amazon are not checking whether the customer is returning the original product with all it's accessories or notA BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF SERVICE."
"Pros1. Loud and clear sound2. Excellent Bass3. Good battery back up4. Nice and cute case5. Backlights looks very fancyCons:1. Sometimes the bluetooth connectivity gives you the pain2. Calling experience is Average, Noise cancellation is bad and sometimes the voice breaks while calling but without earphone voice can be heard clearly3. You will not get to know the amount of charge left which is present in later modelsMusic experience:4/5Calling:2.5/5"
"No noise cancellation, no bass, defective piece sometimes left ear dope getting off sometime right one getting off. Quality of sound very badNo one should buy this bad quality product. Aman you need to be serious we started using boat after watching you in sharktankKindly maintain your quality"
Go blindly for this. I am writing after using one month.This is one of the best buy in terms of Buds.. Very good sound quality.Noise cancellation is best.In single charge of cabinet you can use it for 4 days.Specially will be loved by touring guys.I loved it.
"Dear seller I have replaced this product just after a 3 days of using it cuz of its left airdope defect, it is not charging properly like the left one and it's battery getting down in less than an hour. But you have courtesy to send me the used product in replacement and not even cleaning it so that I would not know that it's been used. Such a dirty one I am not gonna touch it even. Return it."
First of all I'm trying tws for first time . But as a boat rockerz 255 f user( past 3 years + ) i didn't get any extra sound or bass. It's more likely as  currently using headset. But we can give extra of ₹ 800-900 for this kind of technology to avoid wires and more comfortable. . So it's same as boat rockerz 255 f  to me. I used same song for both headset and it's acts same . I think tws has more sound when we put it into max volume.
"Everyone can expect a good sound quality from any earpods. But 😂😂 i guess its cheaper in the range of true wireless or the stuff used in making it is cheap, anyways, its got a disturbance like how old tvs sounded on mute. It isn't even audible with all that heavy base and all but when you're in mood of listening to quite piano songs or just let it be on mute. Damn, its really annoying."
Sound feels good but 2 drawbacks 1. if u r using u can't hear a thing of ur surroundings so using them on the road while driving is a misadventure.  2. After just 30 mins to 1 hr outer years r paining so no comfort in using. U decide how worth it is..
"I have been using this wireless earbuds since 1 year and they have done nothing but cause me trouble. They disconnect every hour, and either one or both earbuds go into silent mode. The battery discharges quickly. I had raised complaint and sent them mails but they haven't replied to either. Please dont buy this, go for other options"
"I bought these after a lot of research for a good set of TWS under 2k. I don't mind the limited functionality for this price but whatever is available, SHOULD WORK. It's been about a week of minimum usage and one airdope has stopped working. I love BoAt's bluetooth speakers and I'm disappointed with this product.Verdict: don't waste your money on this."
"These airdrops 441 pro are good. But it's bass boosted that you will have to go to your eq available on your music player and make the eq flat and even cut the bass further. Otherwise the connectivity is great. Battery backup so far is good.The hardest part is these dopes are not very comfortable for the ears, the rubber pads that lock to ears will cause pain just after 1-2 mins of use. Folks at Boat have done a decent job otherwise, but these rubber supports are causing pain to the ears. Here In my case. Also the noise cancellation is not the best."
I bought this headset on August 2020 and the right side ear headset stopped working on November 2020. After one month of fight with Customer care I got the replacement product on January 2021. But now within a month even the replacement headset right side is not working now. I truly regret buying this headset. Please think twice before buying this headset.
Felt cheated by Boat and Amazon.The main problem is hardware quality. Within 2 months of purchasing touch controls stopped working. I asked for replacement and they took 20 days for it. On top of that replacement is more faultier than original one. Left earpeice was giving hiss sound and right earpiece was disconnecting very frequently. Once again I asked for replacement but this time I visited service center and they have replaced it instantly.I think Boat is giving refurbished products to their customers.
The product was boat airdopes 441 which was completly damage it's one earbuds was not working because it was damage and full of scratch and when I refund then the recieving agent denied to refund and said that I have done this which the product at last I would like to say that do not buy this product through the Amazon
I am writting this review after continous use of ONE YEAR. Yet their is no any complaints and complication till now. If u r looking for a best AIRDOPES then this is it. Their a only a small problem that is when on call the voice is bit low . And when looking all over then its best. its very good in noice cacellatiion etc... and for me it fits in ear very comfortably only when removed that extra thing over that. And also give a large hour play back and bass is also veryy good. Thank you 'BOAT' For This Amazing Product
The overall sound quality is amazing. Treble is clear even at higher volumes. Bass is deep. Connectivity is good. Latency is near about zero. Review is after using it for over a month on a daily basis. Battery life is amazing. Such a power-packed headphone at this price is way beyond what anyone can ask for. Big thumbs up to boat for producing this wonderful gadget.
The sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is good for the person using it but the person on the other side of the call can hear the surrounding sounds more. Yet to get used to the touch. The air drop sit perfectly in the ears. Not heavy. Bluetooth connectivity is very easy n fast.

 I found this airdopes really nice. The sound quality is good, bass quality is also perfect and more importantly the battery backup is superb when I got this airdopes it was already charged and it's been 4 days I am using it without any need to charge, so that is amazing for me."
"I am very disappointed by this boat product. Its been 1 month I bought Boat Airdopes 441pro.I am facing multiple issues with this product like one airdope is not working with in 5 days of purchase.I file a complaint  for replacement under warenty. Boat replaced and provide me old used product. Now this replaced product is also not working properly, call disconnects in between ongoing call. I search on internet for boat bluethooth Airdopes problems to resolve issues and these are the common problem I found in Boat Airdopes. I recommend not to go for Boat."
"Nice fit for medium size ear but not good for small sized ear.Even though BoAt is a indian brand, this particular product is designed in USA and made in china, consider that before purchasing it.I purchased it for a price of 1999/- but it does not worth more than that.Sound clearity is ok i would say. Not for those people who want an immersive experiance."
Sound quality is pretty good but the earphones have a static sound whenever you pause or play something... It gets really annoying pretty fast. I have ordered a replacement to see if the same problem existsUpdate: Even the replacement has the same problem... But the amount of static sound is less than the previous one... Still really annoying. . Would not recommend
"WOW REALLY SUPERB,  IT'S VERY NICE AND 100% IT'S BASS LOVERS AND CALL QUALITY ALSO GOOD , TOUCH CONTROLS IS EXCELLENT.  WE SHOULD BUY BLINDLY.  I WAS USED REALME BUDS Q BUDS TOUCH CONTROLS IS WOREST. I AM FULLY SATISFIED FOR THIS BOAT 441 TWS. FETTING IS EXCELLENT WE CAN USE RUNNING JAGGING AND WALKING EVEN 1% ALSO DON'T FALL DOWN.  THANKS FOR  BOAT."
"It's been only 18days that I bought this product and using. The both earbuds was working fine.After Ten days, the right earbud started not getting charged and I even tried the possibilities to make charge. I feel like waste of money, not even worth the money kept on this product."
The sound quality is very impressive considering the price. The fit is also rather good. No problems while running and workout sessions. Stable bluetooth connection without any lag or stutter. Usb-C charging is a very good extra feature.
Sound quality is very niceAll very niceExcept give adepter with charging cable it is required.For charging no another option only mobile adeptor requiredSo please add adepter with charging cable
"Doesn't feel comfortable in the ears which is major dumb thing, it is very huge and just doesn't properly fit in ear... Sound quality is good for the price point but there's no point talking abt sound when we can't wear it due to uncomfort."
"It's an alright earpod. Could have been better, this was a gift. The person who uses it puts a helmet on when riding bike, on top of this earpod...and it shuts off. The touch responds to not only human hands but to anything that touches it. So the touch ruined the experience, otherwise it's probably fine"
"There are 2 problems with these airdopes:1) One of the airdope gets disconnected or I should say die sometimes for no reason, it gets connected after putting in the case and opening after closing the case.2) There is always a fear of them slipping from ear, due to which you cant use them in public place or outside, they slips very often."
"The product was really good, but my charging pin of one bud got stuck and I claimed warranty. The problem is if your product got replaced you should be lucky enough to get the same color, i got a different colour without any accessories, so i will have to use spirit lime earbuds for grey airdopes 😕"
"I have received this product and was very excited as its says it is a PRO version. The best marketing nonsense.Cons:1. Static noise in left ears2. ears started paining after using it for 1 and a half hours3. touch controls are too sensitive to control. - very irritating4. right earbud often get disconnected5. charging is bad, you will not know if the bud is actually charging or not6. it there is no charge in the buds it will suddenly stop without a warning or something.Pros:1. The case has a good battery capacity"
Bass excellent noise cancellation good and battery the main plus point long lasting with approximately 4.5 hrs playtime and don't just wait grab it
Good ear buds and sound quality. Fits well to ears and does not come out while exercising or any other activity. Playback time is good and does not require frequent charging. Infact the case starts charging as soon as the buds are back in it. It would give it 4.5 stars.
I personally didn't like active noise cancellation. Because the other person is not able to listen me well than my background noise.5star for low latency well i was playing games5stra for base quality i have even tried it with 8d audio5star for sound quality amazing music just keep the volume low when you are walking on streets4star for connectivity i tried to connect it when i was in a bit crowdy area but it took a bit long to connect but the best part is i can connect easily with my laptop
A very good productBass is too goodLook wise better but the 131 one model looks better then thisOtherwise connectivity range of the product is too goodCalling wise satisfiedA too good product in this range
Overall the product is very good.  Sound quality is decent but if you compare it with the products in this process range it's good. Look wise  airdopes are very attractive and specially the light adds up to it. Noise cancellation is not at all effective but didn't even expected it to be at this price range.  Airdopes fit well into ear and might be a bit painful if you use it more than 3 hrs.Overall a great value for money product.
@amit_kumar_dogra oh nature k rakshaq... Hum bhi h nature... Don't forget... It's all part of evolution... We have evolved and so will nature... And there would be losses and gains too... We should stop blaming each other... And accept what comes along... And evolve even more to avoid loss of lives... There is no going back buddy... That's just communist shuts to just play gods by themselves... I am not sure if you can grasp all of it ... Or else you can simple abuse me or my words...
"When I was looking for the this purchase,  I had bass and call both as my priority. So I wanted to write this review for future buyers.. Who are looking like me. The sound quality is awesome. Bass is awesome. Sometimes the connectivity takes time... That seems ok.Coming to the call,  you are able to do that well... When it's not that crowded surrounding...Overall it's good... Recommended."
"Audio and call quality is decent. But daym. Idk if it's just the buds but the noise cancellation beat the Kolkata metro sound and local bus, so I'm happy. I'm impressed at the design and packaging too.For a price of 1900, I think this is the best I could have got.However,I'll get back to this review after using it extensively."
Sound and Bass quality is just average. Noise cancellation is very poor. I thought of going for an Indian brand and was uttermost disappointed with this airdopes 441. Main problem with these ear buds are once it gets connected it will only last for 5-10 minutes after that you cannot hear the voice clearly. Would have given 0 star rating if it is possible on the Amazon platform
Writing this review after use of 1 week of this product.Overall Good tws at budget price.Clear sound with good bass.Good battery backup. In one charge can use about 2-3 days.Cons.Fitment in ears not very firm. Can't use for long time
It's a pretty good product but would have been more better infact best at this price range if it would have allowed multiple connections simulateously. Overall the haptic touch works properly the battery life is good.
"As the product says, bass quality is awesome. However you might want to use equalizer to reduce the bass as some songs can't be enjoyed with the excess bass. The return and replacement service by Amazon is as always the best. Would recommend this. Battery backup is sufficient. No issues. The extra fittings help with ear sizes. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"
The Charging of the box stopped - trying to get in touch with their customer service - they keeping pushing to the website and when we try to go to website - they ask us to send email - if send email they again refer to website or customer service - so no replacement for the product under warranty at all. so i am looping from website to customer service to email and back to website
"The product was Okay, I have bought in a sale , but after 10 days the price has been decreased more than 10% .After  continuous use of  ear buds for 5 mins on call, The noise cancellation and lacking starts .So need to solve this noise cancellation issue.Not much satisfied."
The airdopes have no “dope” really ! Pathetic quality earphones ! DON’T Buy! Waste of money. The airdopes stopped working within a year. The right ear plug stopped functioning even after fully charging it and now the battery backup is also very low. You’ll regret buying this product ! Don’t go for it
I am writing this review after using it over month:Pros- The sound quality is good (but average bass)- It looks good & robust- Good battery backupCons- You just can't wear it for more than an hour.- Very poor noice cancellation even if you are walking on streetsConclusionI would suggest to go for neckband. It looks great but offers poor noice cancellation so will not recommended at this price.
"I received  the airdopes on 21 Feb and followed all the instructions given with the airdopes to be done before using it , still after like within 2 hours of using right ear bud stopped working , which is a very bad experience for a customer who buys the product by investing money . Boat is a very reputed company should do the quality check well before the product is delivered.  It was a very bad experience , I suggest before buying this product do ask people who have used this product or are using this product"
"There is hardly any bass, simple voice calls are so sharp and almost pricks the eardrums. The touch system is over-engineered. Its so confusing to remember to hold 2seconds to do something, 3 seconds to do something, 5 seconds for something else. The flashing lights are very confusing and inconsistent. No wonder there are 50 models listed in Airdopes, you cant get quality with that focus on scale."
First of all the looks are awesome.10/10 for looks.Sound and bass is also good 9/10.But in case of comfort it's not that great.It starts paining in the ear after wearing it for more than 30-40 mins.So 6/10 for comfort.And battery service is the usp for this product once fully charged the case you don't have to worry for atleast a week.And another con of this product is that it does'nt connect correctly sometimes to the pc.There is some problem with the pc connection.Overall 7.5/10.
"I'm satisfied with the earphones. The only drawback that if you wear them for a long time, your ears might hurt. But if you're planning to wear them a couple of hours daily, then it should fine.Sound quality is good and battery backup is good too."
This product is just amazing i ordered it after just 10 mins it was launched and they were delivered exactly at the time they were estimated. The people complaining about left earbud voise is false mine works absolutely perfect. I'd recommend everybody to buy it and it's battery life is the best it's more 150 hours i've been using them from almost more than 1 1/2 week it's still got battery in it
Its awesome!! The sound much better than the other boats. Not done much calling but yeah it works fine there too.. So yeah thumps up for this product the best one in dis price range👍🏻
"Leaving this review for other purchasers to know that they are buying a chinese manufactured product, though it's an Indian brand.The brand/seller should transparently label the product ""made in china"" so buyers who want to avoid/boycott chinese products cant be fooled into the purchase"
Descent performance with just 6mm drivers. Mi earphones dual drivers sounds better than these.Boat 441 has a very low bolume output compared to Mi duak driver earphone.Bass too low.
Product is worth when it comes to listening songs etc but it's not that great when it comes to talking over call as the area it covers is not perfect. It often happened with me that the person on the opposite side wasn't able to hear me or was hearing very less of my voice. Otherwise it's a good one
"Pro:- Battery life is good- Connectivity is good- Good for only calling purpose- Battery is good, It give at 3.5 to 4.5 hr backup at one full charge and with case 22-26hrCons:- Issue with Macbook, not connectivity but sound quality is so poor- Poor sound quality- If volume > 50% sound like rip up- Hurts Upper ear, not comfortable to wear- Skype/MS Team call connectivity issue, it disconnect so frequently and there is so much noise and annoying sound and sometime TWS is connected but no audio- It have only 6mm driver thats a big consOverall is just OK type TWS, If you get this one under Rs. 900, then it is good to compare with price"
"Product is perfect in this price range.Sound quality is excellent, just make sure that you are connecting the device with Mobile/any other devices with good audio output.Connectivity is excellentBluetooth range is goodGreat look and feelOnly con I found, ear start paining {not internal ear but the bones arround it} if used for more than 45 mins"
Used it for songs & movies. Outcome result is very satisfactory. Battery life is very good. Using it for last 10 days without charging it for a single time in between. Its a value for money product. Product built is good. If there is any issue with this product then it is only that the purchase money goes to China.
"I was able to buy this product in 1700 which is an amazing price given the bass quality and good touch panel. The problem that no one is talking about is the static noise issue in the left earbud. It was there in the first product, got it replaced and it was there in the second as well. I bought it again after returning it and then even in the third product the same issue was there. It is very irritating if you listen to podcasts, audiobooks, and videos at low volume. Don't buy it."
"I have used many headphone from boat but this one is not a good product. Writing the review after using for almost 3 months. It keeps getting disconnected or even if connected the sound goes off, many a times sound is in just 1 ear. The audio is decent though."
The sound quality and bass quality of thr product is amazing. I love it. Watching movies and listening to songs in another world. But talking about the microphone it really disappointed me. While making a phone call u will have to scream aloud to make the other person hear what u are sayin. Also same about voice recording in WhatsApp and all. So i m now using wired headphone for making call and Airdopes for entertainment purposes 🤷🏽‍♂️
Product at this rate is definitely worth the penny undoubtedly with a stunning look. Sound quality is at its best while hearing music or video. But major drawback is while using this for phone call. At receiver end voice looks to be distorted. I initially thought it’s the issue with device and replaced it. But no luck. Not recommended for phone calls
"In just 2 months it has stopped working twice. First time it was pickup from home to do replacement. This time customer care wants me to go service centre for replacement. First it seems it is a defective piece that is why it stopped working twice in 2 months. Secondly instead of replacing product immediately, asking customer to go service centre which is 10-15 km from my place, I don’t understand what type of customer care this is? Even after number of reminders, customer care is not responding on my request."
"A BUNCH OF THUGS...KEEP AWAY FROM THIS BRAND... Ordered for RED at a premium price. Had to to get replaced. Got once Grey (Not working), then Blue (Not working), Finally Lemon Green. But accessories were not changed. So I'm getting a JOKER's worth Airdope...Would be too happy to present this item as a gift to the CEO of BOAT....."
"Value for money product. Bluetooth connectivity is reliable. Good sound quality when playing media. While using for phone call, the person on the other side at times were havy trouble understanding conversations - many told me I was sounding lo like having a cold. When not playing media, you can hear some kind of feedback."
"Sound quality is good. No noise cancellation and need to speak a bit louder. Touch is too sensitive. Can be used only with mobiles. Tried to connect to my HP laptop, its showing as 2 different devices and cant playback and listen at the same time. Overall ok for the price. When using 2 buds, microphone is working on only one bud. When used in mono mode, working on both the buds."
"This is a wonderful product! But don't buy it at a high price, minimum 1999 and max 2100 should be a good priceBase level is too goodSound is also brilliantTouch sensitivity is fantasticBattery backup is goodGood for excercise as it won't fall but I would not suggest u wearing them in heavy excercise in which head movement is too much.Noise cancellation is a bit not that goodOverall this is a brilliant product do check it out :)"
"Bought this product for my daughter and since then she has become inseparable with them. Fits well into the ears with good sound quality. However, taking a call using these may not be rated 5 star."
"Always had a terrible experience with boat, I have hardly used it for 3-4 months that too for few hours in gym. After 3-4 months the left earpods stopped charging and working.. what nonsense is this? Boat only spends money on promotion not on good products. This company is worst. All products is good for starting 1 or 2 months then issues will pop up"
"Awesome product.It's looking very nice, sound quality is really nice it gives good amount of BASS, also gives clear sound while playing music. While making calls it gives cristal clear sound, and good noise cancellation, and it fixes in ear very nicely, very good battery backup. It worths every penny.If you are looking for earbuds no agitation go for it. Thank you Boat, thank you Amazon."
"Pros:1. Ultra smooth to connect, even b4 u can think of.2. Very gd sound quality3. Long battery life4. Fast charging5. V gd quality against its price6. Fits into ears v wellCons:1. Not a great mic, especially for noisy surroundingsOverall, a great buy"
Best part is that the pairing is awesome. Using it extensively since yesterday and not for once there was drop in connectivity! It is as good as wired earphones.. sound is superb and bass is apt. Loved it. Will recommend for sure.
"This is the worst experience of product purchase in my life. Not expected from Boat. Voice fluctuates from left to right ear and then right to left ear. Music stops suddenly in between. I requested for refund for which I got a confirmation but later Amazon cancelled the return without notifying me. When I came to know, the return date window was over. I have wasted my 1999 Rs. Now I have asked for replacement from the company as it is within warranty so the person has picked up the eardopes and said that new one will be delivered within 8 to 10 days. Let see what happens with this ..Fingers crossed"
Noise cancellation and sound quality is great considering this price range.You may not be able to wear it for long hours but for short durations they do deliver the quality.Touch is extremely responsive.This product is good to go!
"Cons- Person on other end of the call are unable to hear u, if ur travelling in car/bus/train/bike, noise cancellation helps u to listen to the person on the other end, but they can't hear u lot of time that's a drawback. The charging magnets sometimes don't fit on their own need to adjust a little.Pros- Best for Listening to music if u like the bass, over all a good product for on the go music. The battery time of 150hrs is another good feature , I have timed it yet but has never let me down yet."
"I like this product, sound is awesome, able to pair with all digital media devices, battery life is super cool and process is awesome BUT THE MIC WHEN ON CALL IS NOT THAT MUCH AUDIBLE ON THE OTHER SIDE IS NOT GOOD, HAVE TO TALK SO LOUD TO GET OUR VOICE HEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE"
"they are fairly good earbuds with good sound quality and good touch commands. but there is the issue of fittings. I don't know if it's my ear that is too small or the buds which are too big but the earbuds keep falling from my ears and I have to keep adjusting them again and again. Also, when we speak on a phone call with the earbuds, the person on the other side of the call can hear my voice very low as like I am sitting on a microphone. otherwise, these are good earbuds:)"
"They haven't given the option to increase or decrease volume. It has to be done through device which cn be annoying.Boat neckband gives status through voice, like now you are connected, ready to pair etc. This indicates through lights. So I have to remember the 3 different lights and their meanings. I have to hold in my hands and look while operating.Expected it to be better than neckband but disappointed.audio quality is good though."
At first I trust on boat company seeing less review .I bought boat airdopes 441TWS it showed me connectivity problems and  sound quality also not so good.I thought it's a manufacturer problem  then I returned and ordered same product trusting on boat company but it is clear that  it is totally an untrustable product .On second order it showed major problems from starting which is totally unusable.. I am totally unsatisfied with this brand.... Don't buy this product . It's only wastage of money nd time.
Okay to start with do not go as per the review.1.It doesn’t fit correctly and if you try to wear it you will have a ear pain.2. The quality of sound is not great also MIC doesn’t function properly.3.The colour I went for Is flashy and it’s not subtle.4. MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS ITEAM IS NOT RETURNABLE!!!!!! You only have an option to replace with the same pair of AirDopes (lol)So not worth a buy..
Boat was the most trustworthy and reliable product for me till I brought this Boat airdopes 441I bought it during prime day sal.Many of the airdopes 441 has the same issue which were sold during that period :Left earbuds will make some sort of noise after some time of usage which makes your ears pain and using it for an hour or more you feel annoyed.And there is no noise cancellation which makes this not at all viable for  Calls.I got replacement still found the same sort of problemBut Pros being sound quality a decent bass at this price as always promised by Boat
"The airdopes pair with laptop however when connected the sound transfer does not happen and if it does it is when they are place on the laptop key board. Works absolutely fine with mobile. Sent for replacement to bOAT and they replaced them with 441 instead of 441 pro,  And that to does not transfer sound from Laptop as well as Iphone  Now when I have lodged a compliant again  a couple of days ago these guys are not responding  at all nor their service center takes any responsibility . Bad Product and Customer Service."
"Used it for 1 year on an average of 5-6 hours per day. Passive noice cancellation, bass is good. The sound was balanced even in 100% volume for some 3-4 months after purchase. But now the treble has slightly increased. And I love the battery backup. I usually charge the case once in a month. Not that good for gaming (latency). But great for music lovers. Overall this is a good tws, and it is worth that price."
"I'm giving 1 star for the after sales service and the product quality. I bought the product on 13th June and within 2 months the left earpod is not getting charged in the charging case. I have bought 1 Bluetooth headset, 1 Bluetooth Speaker, 1 Bluetooth Earpod and 1 wired earphone from Boat and the only thing still working is the Bluetooth speaker maybe because I paid a hefty amount on that and as instructed in the Boat site to avail warranty I raised the ticket or request and uploaded the invoice downloaded from the Amazon site.  Later I received a mail stating that the invoice is not valid or clear. I have repeatedly sent the mail attaching the downloaded invoice copy from amazon site and still they haven't given a revert. They are not going to replace your product if it's faulty and they are the biggest thieves I have ever seen. I made a great mistake by purchasing boat products and I regret that I spend more than 10k on this low quality products."
"The best in the market...For me I am satisfied with the quality.Only con i can say is the grip, very slippery and touch sensitive while removing from box or while adjusting in the ear, the call get disconnected."
These eardopes are Good in sound quality. But they are too heavy and not comfortable. If you watching your phone while sitting or if you lie down on your bed then they will fall down eventually. They are too heavy for my ears. I tried changing the ear cups several time but not much improvement. Returned them.Sound and call quality is good. No problem in connectivity. Buy it only if you okay with their weight. Try them maybe you will get accustomed them in few days or weeks
"Everything is top notchfrom bass to fitting but the only problem is left earbud’s battery drains faster than right earbud. I have ordered replacement today, hoping for the best. If this issue gets resolved then for me this is the best ever earbud under 1399/-Update: same issue is present in replaced unit. Returning it. Thank you amazon for accepting return & refund request."
"I received it today i.e 28th July 2020 and with the 6 hours I used it out of the box, the battery dropped from 67% to 11%.I'm going to update this review after a full power cycle of the charge in the headphones.For it being the first day here's my feedback -Volume 3/5 - Could be better, a 5-6% lower volume than the JBL 205BT that I also haveAudio Spectrum 3/5 - The sound image is Bass heavy, there were instances where the bass overpowered and masked all other frequencies. Thumbs down for music consumption. It still is great for Movies, Shows and Games.Features 4/5 - The touch controls are sensitive and even a scrape of any part of your body might pause or change the track. Although I really wish there were volume controls for this. Volume needs to be adjusted manually from the paired device.Build 4/5 - Good build quality and stable fit in the ears. The point deducted is for the charging box lid which is just loose and cheap feeling when open.Overall for the first day of use I faced no pairing issues with the variety of devices I connected to and I'm waiting to review it further 3 months down the line."
"There were other reviews explaining the same issue of hearing a static noise in addition to music from one of the buds. One reviewer pointed out that even his exchanged product had same issue. I will update review if my exchanged product is better or worse.EDIT: The new exchanged product also had a similar issue with the noise. But it was not as prominent as the previous one. So, I guess this brand and model has the issue. So please make an informed decision before buying.[Other than the noise, everything else seems fine and good.]"
"Can't use while riding bike, and crowded placesOr place where noise bcoz the people in other side of the call can't hear our voice clearly instead they hear our surroundings noise more and the senser also very sensitive can't even touch to fix in ear as soon u to touch if ur in call or listening music it will cut the call and music will stop and also after used for 3 to 4 months i can't use for calling thou i allowed for calls, did everything ( unpaird, paired switch off on nothing happened ) I am regrating after buying this product want my money back!!!"
Sound quality is amazing battery backup is good but one thing boat should immediately stop doing is putting a rubber thingy (ear support might be) on thier headphones in a name of creativity its irritating and no one asked one please take it as an critical Review and try to avoid your overdone stuff to headphones
The left ear bud was not working . Placed a replacement order. Got the replacement today and this one is also defective. Getting a static (tr tr tr tr....) sound from the left ear bud. I had faced this same problem with my Boat 441 pro. I think all the product of boat 441 n 441 pro have a manufacturing defect.Ive tried to contact the customer care of Boat but there is no reply from themUpdate on 23Sep - This is the 3rd time im ordering this product n I have always recieved a defective product i.e. there is a static noise from both the earbuds. Very disappointing product by Boat.
"I like these airdopes. They are light, doesnt hurt my ears, easy to carry and gives good sound quality. Boat is a trusted brand and I have mulitple audio devices from the company. I recommend this product"
"Boat airdopes 441 earbud1. Mic of the earbud is not work properly, their is generate an echo to the other side.2. Range of the bluetooth is very bad.3. At the time of conversation some times on other side person is unavailable to listen my voice clearly.4. Quality of the sound and Bass of the earbud is good only, not excellent.5. Uncomfortable in the ear."
"I like bass so I like the sound of Boat 441. I also tried Boult powerpods which were quite flat when compared to Boat 441, but definitely more clear and crisp. It depends on individual choice I guess. Connection is good and immediate (I love it), but range is just ok, not great."
Over all performance build quality and powerful base are awesome but little bit left side bud produce static noise issues after open every applications and youtube etc. So please solve the issue and replace me a very good  condition. Thank You.14th Aug 2020After Replacement this product is received very good condition and solved issue. Thanks to Amazon and boAt.
"I basically bought this to use for office calls during this WFH situation.The sound quality is not at all good during the zoom or MST calls. There is disturbance during the calls.The mic was bad for the first device I got and had to get it replaced with new one. The new one has better mic but not the best. The connection to laptop gets disconnected after some time - this problem existed in both devices I got.If you plan to use these for office calls etc during this WFH situation, please avoid."
"The product is great no doubt. But when connected to a phone or a laptop there is some hissing noise, in the left earphone. When connected to a laptop sometimes there is a bit delay when pausing or playing the video. Haven't measured the battery in terms of hours but with a moderate two hours play a day it will last a good amount of time."
"Sound quality is good and bass also good but not that much as I expected from boat but yes I m happy with the sound quality. Easy to connect and operate. I didn't check the battery back up for both tws as well as the case, will check and update later."
This airdopes is just wow 😍I got it only in 1999And at this price range the sound quality is awesome and i am bass lover this airdopes have very deep bassI tried realme buds Q but this not much better and they don't have led indecatersBecause boat airdopes have it so it halp to know the signalsMost great this is that it have extra grip bcoz of its earfines 😍 it fit very wellAt this price range call quality is good
"The voice breaks in call, there is some 'sssssss' background noise & both earbuds doesn't sync. Unfortunately cannot return it only replacement possible. Disappointed with this kind of quality at this price."
"This is the worst wireless earphone out there. The right earphone just stopped working within a month. Not recommended to buy it, you can look at other options."
"Best budget true wireless airpodes. Bought this on prime day sale when I am confused among different boat airpodes types. What makes this 441 pro as a pro is its Ipx7 protection & 2600mah battery that can be also used as powerbank for mobile (however, we shouldn't use completely for this purpose, prefer to use in emergencies).Overall it's a good airpodes at this price. You can go for it if you want to buy a good budget airpodes"
"dont go by the ratings of boAT products. They spend money on brand ambassadors and ratings. Performance wise lousy products. i bought two boAT headphone. both stopped working. one was under warranty (airdopes 441) so got the replacement. Even the replacement stopped working. Both had the same issue, the left earbud doesnt charge, doesnt connect, doesnt work."
Within a few days left side bud had some issues voise was not clear right side bud batt was low in 20mins just the look is good even the magnetic closure loosens in a few day use.its worth a 1ooobucks not more than that.and yes it falls out from the ears it wil just slip out easily...Had very high expectations  but sadly returned the product.
"I gifted these to my friend.She loves it but the only issue is people with small ear canal can have an issue with the fit of this.And no, changing to different sized buds won’t help.Otherwise good sound quality."
Very good product... what you get is a technological edge and value for money ....just go for it in case you are looking for in ear BT airdopes.
First i received a faulty product which use to discharge quite quickly. So i replaced the item and thankfully now i have a good pair of earpods. Good to hear songs and easy to hear while on call. They are not noise cancellation ones but overall good product which doesn't hurt your ear.
The sound quality was awesome. But some times the bus was disconnected automatically.This bud is a bad choice for making Calls. Because there is no noise cancellation even sometime our voice will not  hear to the person who was in call.
I bought them on may 15th as a bday gift for myself.... I was so confused to buy them or no cuz of all the negative reviews... But trust me guys these earbuds r awesome.. Crystal clear sound and evrything is just balanced... The only thing is if ur ears r small then these r a bit uncomfortable but managable... So guys its a thumbs up from my side... Battery backup is also good... The case when fully charged lasts for around 15 days :)But sometimes i found a problem in calls and thats rare
"Wireless earbuds need to get more mainstream, so I take this generation as early prototypes. Quality is good, usability is intuitive, battery life is long.Only issue I have with this is that I can't lie on my sides and watch something. Ears hurt cause they're not really super small (like a wired earbud)."
"Everything is excellent except few things such as1. Volume can't be adjusted using airdopes2.when v try to adjust the airdopes ,some function is performed ( when v would touch )3.As it's size is small  sometimes it falls downOther than these everything is best and perfect 🤩🤓😁🥸🤘🏿"
"Fitting is also very good. Negligible chance of falling down. Compared it with one plus z (bass edditon) one plus has more rich bass and clarity. But for TWS category,it is the best."
Noise cancellation is pathetic. The person at the other end can hear the sounds of the surroundings over the speaker's voice. That too the surrounding sound is amplified and is so loud that it troubles the person at the other end.What is the use of all the other swanky features when this basic feature is missing?Highly disappointed.
1. Charging case says each bud has 35 mAh battery but on Boats website  its mentioned 43 mAh for each bud2. Case quality seemed to be lower than the the previous I had from last year.3. Its with Matt finish now which is not mentioned anywhere.4. Made in India not mentioned on charging case which has all the same logos as the China version I had from the last year.Doubtful if they sent the actual Indian Product or just written on the box or even if the product is genuine.
1. Easy and smooth handling2. Light weight3. Awesome looking4. Best product in this range5. now a day online working i mean for work from home best product for conversation6. easy to use for office hour online meeting6. easy and best sound quality for music and moovie7. Choices and available in different colour8. Better connectivity9. soft and smooth sound quality10. Also comfortable for children and old age
"Boat is known for its bass , They won't let you down . Battery backup is also gud . Case is very small so doesn't feel load while carrying . Sound quality is good . Noice cancellation is average . You are audible to others in public places too bt you have to keep your tone a bit louder. At last ..go for it ...after buying it you will completely forget your wierd earphones. Shape is good . Won't fall from ears even running."
"After using it for 6 months, sound in the right piece stopped working. I feel like a deaf while using it now. I cannot return the item now since the return window is over. I should either dump it or use it with one piece.People planning to buy, think twice."
"I think i am the first to order yellow colour. Product delivery is on time.I will update the Product performance shortly after using for a while.But I suggest if you are looking for calling purpose, then this are not best. Volume level is low during calls and you have to speak louder.Music purpose- you will love it."
Battery backup on single use is very less compared to Boult. Boult true buds gives more than 5hrs on 70% vol. This only gives max 3.5 hrs. Call quality is very bad. The other person hears some kind of noise along with your voice.  Product is not apt for the price. Won't recomend.
These airdopes are extremely worthless .. No value for money .. right earbud is not working ..  I ordered these airdopes on 4th august and received them on 7 august . After getting delivered i did the unboxing and connected them with my phone and the right earbud was not working .. also the sound quality is not good .. amazon is not refunding me the money too for this product as they are saying this product can only be replaced and not returned.. I have wasted my money on this worthless product already so can't think of buying another .. But u guyz honestly don't buy these airdopes ..
"Sound quality is fine. But the touch feature is quite of an inconvenience. Even if my hair touches the touch sensitive part, calls get cut or music gets paused . Apart from that the earpiece has fallen numerous times from my ear while I was using it, not that it isn't strong enough, but I almost lost one piece due to this issue. Charging capacity is fine."
"Decent product in affordable price.Sound quality is excellent.Good Noise cancellation.Fast pairing.Other person can't hear my voice properly on phone call. So i need to keep one earbud in my hand near mouth during speaking on call.The thing truly disappointed me is, initially the battery backup of both earbuds was good. But after using around 10 months, earbuds batteries are draining very quickly within  10-15 minutes of use."
They are amazing  but hurt the ears after wearing for long period of time u can go for the 411 pro also they give u better battery backup with case buy just paying 400 more I got this on sale for 2000 was a good deal amazing they don’t fall of from the ears so don’t have to worry losing them noise cancellation is amazing no background noise while listening
One earpod isn't getting charged...if by chance I put a lot of efforts and try put it properly...I realised much later why one earpods charge gets so quickly compared to the other one...the design of charging isn't correct for the left earpod in the box... unexpected this from boat and Amazon...I have always bought all my bluetooth products from boat and Amazon ...really disappointed
UPDATE: I sent the earphones for replacement (as one side was getting discharged very quickly) The company received my earphones on 10th May and they still haven't dispatched the replacement! I am writing this review on 20th June.Original review:I love the audio quality and bass quality of these earphones. The only thing that is not up to the mark is microphone. You have to speak louder on calls and sometimes the other person hears surrounding noises more than your voice. So for people whose main purpose is calling and meetings these are not perfect for them.
Sound quality 3.5/5Bass 4.7/5Battery life 4hrs 36mins in my usage per single charge on buds and over all you will get 28 hrsNoise cancellation:-While listening to music 4.7/5While calling 4/5 the mic can't eliminate air noiseBut other side can hear me without any problemCharging time 40mins-1hr for budsGot it at 1799 on sale and even you can spend 1999 but i think it doesn't worth 2500Overall you can go for it
"Thought would take bluetooth headphones so that i don't have to face, one side not working likewise in wired headphones issues but with this as well one side has reduced volume i have checked the troubleshooting FAQs did all it mentions...but still doesn't work properly....if your buying to avoid one side not working likewise in wired....then would not recommend this."
At this cost this is a decent wireless ear phone with mic. Works well though it does need some getting used to. Has a not so great battery backup. In one charge goes up to not more than 2.5 - 3 hrs at stretch
"I was very skeptical at first abt these earbuds but afterter going through many online comparison videos I decided to take these ans I'm so happy I chose these its the best u can get in the given price amount the sound is amazing keeps u grooving, noise cancelation is good to but not too much but it's perfect, the latency is low but not much of the difference while gaming and the best part is they do not get spilt by small droplets of water or sweat I would highly recommend to go for these ."
The charge last for less than 4 hours.Fit could be improved. The buds sometimes fall out of the ears. Can’t use it when travelling or moving because of that. Kind of defeats the purpose for buying them
"It's been 9 months i took the airdopes 441 of boat. I have checked its sitting comfortable in ear and its light weight and i don't feel them when song is on, i listen only song.The bass was awesome and at correct frequency and the sound is good with high quality output. I have also put on them during rain also, still they are working good and pairing quickly.I am getting a total of 20hr playback including case. I suggest these at that cost."
Superb Airdopes ! Just go for itFits well and doesn't fall offWaterproof - I m shocked that by mistake these pods got washed in jeans pocket for half hour. To my surprise after removing n drying they r functioning just as earlier..Very happy with the quality.
"Just got it today. Initial review. It's solid. The sound is crisp and clear. Bass is high quality and not muddy at all. Did not expect this level of quality but this has blown it outnof the water. I bought the 'pro' version. Case is solid, high quality and feels good to hold. Battery life is claimed to be insane on the pro model, lets see how it goes. Initial review, I'm falling in love with many songs that sound fresh using this earbud."
Earbuds are not in sync. When manual earbud switch off tried then only either of them get switched off and not together..same tried with factory reset but light blinks only on left one as required and not on right. So it look like both pieces are not in sync with each other. Calling quality is not so good...u really need to talk louder some times. Overall not a good experience..n as it's under replacement policy only....so be careful before buying this earbud.
"Writing this review after 1 year of use , after expiring warranty period left side earpod stopped working so Buy Non Chinese product because they have only 1year of life as soon as Warranty period's over it'll get defected. So don't expect it to long last."
"After using more than 6 months, I can say the product is fair enough but it is not as expected from Boat. I am facing little bit issue along with right side of burd such as - low sound, less battery backup, voise issue over call and suddenly it has gone too low and I am trying to get it replaced now. Plse go through reviews then purchase as I bought after getting enflunenced with brand's name only."
Personally i am more than satisfied from these airdopes. The sound quality with heavy bass is par excellence. Battery backup is more than enough.  Highly recommended.
"I have been using Boat Airdopes 441 for the past 3 months. Till now i havnt faced any kind of problems. Am really satisfied with the production. And i had many incidence with the plugs. Like, when i was going for a walk i accidently droped it into a water hole, but it was all ok after few minutes. I am really enjoying it."
It's a decent product. Not got really upto the mark result with using it more than a month. M using it with only my phone (Single ohone). Sometimes it gets trouble to connect automatically with the same phone. Noise cancellation is not satisfied. Sometimes it get trouble when I talked through a phone call.
Good quality decent bass. Sound quality on call is good no problem .Problem are1 when inserting or tsking out of est 5ouch gets pressed n call cuts. Not a big issue2. It creats a cacume in the esr which is not comfortable using the smalles head also . But fiting is decent. Value for money
I bought them on the day of their launch and they lasted me less than six months. This includes a replacement that took Boat 5 weeks to carry out. They're steeply priced for an average output. The service is time-consuming. Longetivity is a laugh. The only thing I can guarantee is that they won't fall out of your ears and that is really. Not reason enough to spend 2-grand on a device.
I bought this for my dad so that he could receive calls while driving. It is easy to  connect and easy to use. Also it snug fits our ears well so there is no fear of accidentally dropping them. It has good battery life and also I loved the colours.
"This is an honest review...First of all the package 📦 was awesome 😎And the case is good...good quality product it’s not look like cheap.sound quality is better not awesome.charge capacity I think it goes 4 hr...the battery 🔋 backup is great in this price range.not much bass quality...the one of the problem for me is tha capacitive touch is automatically touch the pillow while in bed watching movies 🎥 it’s happening some times...while happening this the movie or song will be paused...The mic is not so good 😊 while pickup a call we need to higher the voice,while sending whatsapp audio using this product the sound is just lower and little bit crack...No other issues...Nice product👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"Best product at this price so far!!! Better noise cancellation than most other headphones. Doesn't hurt at all to the ears. Battery life is amazing - I used them for 3 days , and yet 50% was left. Even the mic is amazing , sounds clear to the person on the other side. And ofcourse , the music that you listen is also amazing!!!"
"The sound of the eardopes was great. Worked good and also provide battery backup of about 4 hours per charge on almost half volume. It was written that the charging case can charge 4-5 times, but it was unable to charge earbuds completely even 3 times, so I returned it. They provide me the replacement but they send used product in replacement, the seal was opened and also eardopes were dirty as if someone used them. So I returned them. The seller should be ashamed of sending used products even in covid time"
"I've been using these Airdopes for 44-5 days now. The sound effect on music is amazing with perfect bass and deep groove. Battery backup is also quite good. However, connection and sound quality is very poor when used on calls. Too much disturbance, voice breaks a lot back ground noise takes control too. Returning the product coz of the same."
"Product is very good in terms of sound quality, and easy to use. Touch gesture , mic, etc working properly. Only unsatisfying thing is the battery on left ear bud discharges very very early in compare to right earbud (almost 45 min earlier) .  And also the battery of each ear buds don't last more than 3.5 hr of continuous usage.  And the battery of the case last maximum of 15 hrs."
"Pros:-Very fast connectivity less than 2 secBass is very loud according to priceMids and treble are not that much satisfying like bass but okay with itCharging backup is descentLight weightCons:-Fitting not up to the markDon't expect any kind of noise cancellationDO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES LIKE PUBG,COD etcThere is delay while playing these kind of gameI'm highly disappointed after buying these earpdods.Actually I've bought these for mainly playing games but now I'm regretting that I've chosen these earpods for gamingConclusion:-If you want to listen music, want to use as handsfree for callinga and all then you should go for it in this price rangeButIf you want to plat any kind of heavy games like PUBG,COD then don't buy this"
"overall performance and the quality of the product is really awesome and people can promote this type of products in market instead of wasting money in other brand like Boss, JBL & Sony which has a same quality"
The sound quality of the product is amazing but there is a cracking sound at high volume which is present even after I got a unit of airdopes replaced! The volume is not that high I felt you will have to push it to the threshold above 80% almost all the time! It's a good product but with some flaws! Got it in the same for 2k!
"Well I'm a runner, and I'm using them for a while. So I can tell you that ;1) It's Waterproof, no doubt at all. I tested them while running in the rain.2) It fits in you ear perfectly.3) it's got a good bass and sound.4) Go for it without any hesitation"
"Bluetooth - Faltu. Both earbuds work in mono mode only. Whatever you do, reset infinite times, either the earbuds are not pairing with each other or do not show in bluetooth devices.It doesn't have good sound quality. Where is the base A-man?"
First  I ordered the same model but I had a defect in sound quality . I was nit satisfied with sound performances . So I placed a replacement . Within two days I got replacement . Thqnk u so much for replacements and quick delievery . The new product was very good and I am very satisfied with Amazon for quick initiatives .
IPX7 theek hai eska .Bass over hai ..noise cancelation naam ki to koi cheej nahi hai.Slow charging.Sounds quality rate ki hisaab se kam hai ..Mujhe yah 26 January ki sale m mila hai.Esko maine 1699 ka liya hai .1500 se upar lena bekaar hai esko.
Sound quality above averageNo noise cancellationA bit painful to my right earlobes and left earlobes fits with the  airdopesTouch sensor above averageBattery capacity as promisedWhat I liked the most was charging pod for its size and design 👌
After using for 3 months I am writing this review.battery back is now for 5 -7 mins and voice calling is dead.decide yourself wisely.not worth a penny.fraud company.I don't even want to talk to these people .Horrible experienceI request every indian who is rich or not rich doesn't matter ...but please don't buy this product it is worst than any other can could not  imagine.....plz I beg to your legs don't buy this stuff.....plz Boycott this. .....its a request.
Uncomfortable to wear.Poor sound quality.Capacitive touch is not convenient to use.LED lights are very annoying.Bluetooth connectivity is not reliable. Disconnects often.Overall verdict: Very poor. I would never recommend.
"Very nice gadget.. the problem I felt is if we used both pieces, the out side sounds completely out.. it's not a bad remark. But the normal head phone allow the sounds from outside..Good battery backupEasy connectionRecently I noticed that while travelling the calls are not clear to other end. I am very disappointed ☹️"
This is nice product under this price rangeThe bass and sound quality is really good and appreciate the work from boatBattery back up is good as wellThe only thing boat can improve or additionally provide is the extra pair of earbuds of different sizesOn the whole this is a good airdopes to go for
"I bought this not more than a month back , within this time period I am facing few issues like bluetooth connectivity etc. I tried to reboot and then that issue will appear again within few days . I claimed then my warranty claim .As per my experience , sound quality wise there is no complaint ,but if user face issue within 1 month of purchase then definitely it's not a right choice .Please don't go for it. Reaming in your hand ."

 Very good product from the boat. Awesome bass quality. Noise cancellation is also ok, but you can't use a tws for calling because of the distance between the mouth and the mic. But I would say the calling quality is average, not so good. Other than this, boat airdopes tws is an excellent product. Go for it."
"Though i purchased based on good reviews, it has stopped charging for one of the pods in 1 month itself which is not good. I tried to charge it with various ways but it just does not work. :( This is not expected when you are spending good amount of around 2k even when there was boat product with 1200 Rs also available. I went for higher version in the hope that it will be much better but unfortunately the product experience was quite disappointing. :("
"product quality is goodbut don't buy itif u r using it for phone calls, meetings then this is not the right choiceand this can drop down easilyafter some days battery will not stay more than one hourit's waste of money"
"I honestly had a lot of hopes from these airdopes as these were the best tws under 2000 bucks that were suggested in a lot of websites. And i must say, they are literally above my expectations!!! The sound quality is awesome, the bass is very very very good, the colour is perfect, the microphone is neither great nor bad! Overall the product is awesome !!"
"The unit which I received was defective so had to replace it which took 20 day for replacement (replacement pickup & drop was done by bolt which was awesome), the bass is awesome& sound quality is good  but u will experience latency quit often......from the price point it's good."
The quality and performance is much beyond my expectations. Feeling so happy that i went for this product and also  another matter of pride is that its Made in India.
Sound quality is really poor.. if you have budget go for airpods else I have heard OnePlus/Jabra/JBL are good... Please don't waste money here.
The Airdopes are a little heavy but you will get a hang of it after wearing it for a day or two. The sound quality is good and the mic also works nicely. Here are my ratings:Design: 5/5Ergonomics: 4/5Sound Quality: 3.5/5Mic Quality: 4.5/5Battery back-up: 5/5Pros:Small sizeNice builtBattery backupWaterproofPriceCons:It should have been a little lighterVerdict:If you're getting this for 2499 go for it probably the best one under 3000 price range
Got mine delivered today. The packaging was excellent.I'm not an expert in these areas but the bass sound is low which is what i preferred. Also its stays in your and doesn't drop off even when you're jumping since i go for jog and do jump rope i really needed an earbud with good support. So I'm very pleased with the purchase. 9/10 would definitely recommend others (1 point deducted because the design is quite simple and not many color ranges)
"The sound quality is just superb! You can feel the power of the bass and the noise cancellation is awesome. The fins provided on the airdopes help them to stay in your ear intact. You can Run, Jump or Shake your head extremely fast without worrying about the airdopes dropping.STOP THINKING AND JUST GO FOR IT!!"
Is it showing 5999 and offers at 1999 don’t yet fooled it’s not worth of 5999 MRP. Just fooling all to show 4000 discount .It drips from ear frequently u have to be alert if not u don’t know where u will lose it. Better buy One plus or real me buds by paying 1000 to 2000 extra
"I have used boat head phones before using this one with 10mm driver gives very good music quality and the bass is perfect and its drivers are 6mm and audio qualitybelow average and bass and trouble is good in this And now let's talk about bassThe bass of boat 441 is also averageEverything the rest of the company claims is true Boat 441 The case is of a very standard style and feels very good when taken in hand, its connectivity is very good and fast and you can enjoy music movies continuously in your ears for about 5 to 6 hours."
It's a very amazing product..the system quality and sound quality is Awesome. i purchase any product with lot of discussion and reviewing about the product .and I take right decision to buy the product.the company boat launch such beautiful and best product to there customer..I'm very happy  what the product I received ...u can gift any of ur family members or frnds it will very nic and Dy feel  happy on this kind of products.thank u for the company boat and Amazon 😍😍😍.
"For this price range bass, battery capacity, design looks good. But when pairing and while playing there’s a buzz sound, which is so irritating. Besides the buzz sound.. it’s fantastic. A music lover like me cannot withstand that buzz while listening to music"
"Pros:-Really classy design- Fits properly. Doesn't cause issue while running.-Sound quality doesn't hamper on full volume-Great for this price rangeCons- Sound quality and bass was quite a disappointment(I am using apple wired earphone, boat does not come any closer to it. Though again me comparing boat to Apple is stupidity)- Ear sensors quite sensitive. Even if i touch to adjust a bit it gets paused. May b il hav to get hang of it- In second use one of it stopped working..I had to put it back in case and retry. Makes me worried about future ;)"
The best thing of this product is that it is very handy and convenient no much bother about Tangled wires.as my little baby doesn't let me talk over phone and he just grabs any kind of wire around me.😛liked it very much though its back up is not that great.
Best of best bass ... Its like i was searching for this sound from last 10yrs..bought many bluetooth headphone which includea jbl as well. But sound of this is just awesome. My search ends here.. thanks boat u created this marvel device.. super valur for money..dont think jus buy before stock ends.
Am writing this review after using these buds for 1 week. Theses are very good comfortable for short term use but as u waer these for long time it became little uncomfortable. Another problem it is difficult use then on field work. It is very difficult to use them under helmet and on bike mic sound is very poor for listen. Overall it is ok to use for entertainment not for professional work.
Pros : sound quality is good (for music)Fitting is goodBattery backup is goodBass is on point not too heavy not too lightCons: case is huge to carry in pocket3/10 time you will face connectivity issueCalling quality is not too nice on receivers endIt catches too much background noisePoor quality of eartips
"Sound & bass quality is so good while listening to songs but the same sucks while in a call or a meeting. Could hear lot of disturbances during that. Bluetooth sync works fine 4/5 times. Overall, if you're searching earbuds for music listening purposes, this is the one to go."
Sound is good..more on bass side.. so I have to turned down bass from my Dolby amp of OnePlus. Worked nice for first 1 month . But now facing connectivity issues.  If I will not use headphones for few days and then will try to open case it don't connect your headphones.. u need to put charging cable to jump start the case and then it get connect. Also after 1 hr it feel painful in year .

 Noise cancelation is good, good sound quality, good bass, 100% is extreame, only problem is the light wont work at the same time only at a time one side of the earbud ill glow i tried factory reset and it doesn't work no other problems, 3-4hours charging in earbud about 4+hours lifeThe case is getting heat while chargingMy headset is blinking blue colour in a sertain intervalAt first it didn't blink now it blinks i don't know whyThe timing of light in buds is blinking in different time"
Pros.1. Battery life is very good.2. Sound quality is good.3. Bass is also good according to its price.4. Type c fast charging.5. Single earbud can be used individuallyCons.1. Calling quality is poor.2. Poor noise cancellation.
The sound is good. But the left earpod continuously drops. The left earpod crackles first and then in seconds both the left and right ear pods stops working and then only right ear pod starts working. It took me few days for using it so I missed the 7 days return period. Now I came to know from several other reviews in other websites that lot of peoples are facing this issue. So I suggest not to go for this.
"The quality and looks are good. Bass, sound quality are meeting the standards considering brand as Boat. However, its not that good while talking on mobile phone. They also dont go well with whats up video or audio call. The second reason i bought these was so that i could easily talk on phone while doing some other work. But the connectivity is bad on calls. Overall good service by Amazon."
"Have requested for replacement, as I am posting this review, but most likely I will return and take refund.It has good fit and ergonomics, but that's all there is.It's decent for listening music, but the connectivity goes off intermittently for fraction of a second every now and then.But when you are receiving calls, the person on the other side is not able to hear you.You need to shout so that other caller can listen and that's not acceptable."
"Product was as expected in terms of sound quality, battery life and overall sound quality.But.......There is no offer actually. The original MRP is Rs 2,499/- only. How can they increase the price to 6k and then quote 2.5k. Indians are not fools!"
"Amazed to get this airdopes, the voice is crystal clear with bass. Auto connectivity with the device. Must go for this. Battery backup is superb."
"Slightly some drawbacks are there with this eardopes ....main thing is this eardopes getting heavy noise with whoom u are talking with ...and boat is a brand for bass ...but in this Boat  didn't reach u r expectations...read my honest review before u want to buy this product ....and one more thing ...I have purchased this product  yesterday now one ear bud was not working ....I returned this product, NOTE:but everyone expecting ,:if this product is not working or didn't like, u guys are returned this product ...but that option IS not available for this product u can only replace this product with the same ....."
"I recommend not to buy these earpods as these doesn't fit the ears well . That can be only my case even may be not for other ear fitting but it pops out time and again from the ear . And touch is quite irritating as while inserting inside the ear it pauses the song played or other touch features . Moreover voice assistant is just for name it doesn't responds to the command at all , very rearly ."
"After use of 20 days,I buy it name of boAt.But,it's not good as expected.Right side Pod discharge in 15 minutes,also It's not charge properly.i m electronics engineer so I know how to put inside of pod case,So no issue of It's properly put or not."
"Well it is good but don't ever try to compare with Sony, Panasonic etc (accoustic gurus). I am not happy with noise cancellation issue when I use for calling purpose. When you use 'indoor' problem is minimal, but when 'outdoor' problem goes beyond consideration. Next price is too high."
The noise cancellation is to much of cancellation.Good fit afterall.Bass is good and if u wear both u will not be able to hear the outside noise.And yes it will pain ur ears after wearing it for long time like 2to3 hours.So think n buy.
"I've bought this about 2 month's back, I found that right bud has cracking noise(disturbance) in 2 days. I requested for exchange but the exchange order was not filled. I called helpline twice,  they raised return request which is still pending(for about 1 month) . Thanks to Amazon for such a great delivery and exchange experience. Now I am referring all my contacts to switch to other RELIABLE platforms. Because we cannot stand with such a great customer service provider."

 This is very good quality product I also purchase this product I prefer this product and rating this product 5 out of 5 amazing unbelievable product I request you to please trust on boat company and purchase this product and you don't have any issue on this product in maximum 3 years not I also guarantee of the product this product sound quality 5 out of 5 and noise cancellation 5 out of 5 and this product quality is 5 out of 5"
Airdopes is awesome some quality is awesome and battery is tooo awesome last long for 12 hrs after single charge of case and airdopes last long for 3 hrs..qyality is premium and grips is also go not fall from ear and call quality is also good caller can hear uh neatly nd clear voice from both side..so dnt think too much just go for it value for money guys..this airdopes is all rounder battery sound call quality and grip to ear is awesome just buy it..dont think  have a good day
"The pods are good for the price I got on sale, at 2k rupees. The bass quality is good, the noise cancellation and quality are good too.As fr as cons are considered, the pods could have been improved in design to be more snug in ears . The chance of pods falling off your ear are good. And the pods sometimes dont get paired with each other OR will not be able to be seen on bluetooth devices. But once you 3 tap it to factory reset and place them in case and remove again. They work. But this is starting to become a real hassle as it is happening often enough."
I am writing this review after use of 1 month.1. Sound quality : it's quite satisfactory.2. Noise cancellation: Here also it's quite satisfactory performance.3. Bass quality: I see it excellent performer in comparison to the price you get it.I feel down only when it disconnects suddenly.  It has not happened so frequently but seems to be little problem.All over I feel that its best in class products. Value for money..👍😀
It stuck in my ear and difficult to took it out.Don't buy
Takes a while to get used to the 6mm drivers but they are sufficient. The bass is superb and noise cancellation is sufficient too! Call quality is quite good but it picks up some background sound in heavy traffic. All-in-all I would recommend this to anyone with a budget of 0-3000. GO FOR IT!
The sound quality is good at the given cost.The base is not that deep but is decent with crisp quality premium sound while listening musicNoise cancellation at this price note is really goodFits really well in ears at times I forget that it is in my earsIts not at all for calling purpose as it catches a lot of surrounding sound
I wanna give real review because everyone's money is precious like me.. If You want to listen only music then this product is good..But if you want to talks with calling then this is totally worst product... Your call reciver never can hear you clearly..I changed it 2 times(returns) but my problem was not solve.. Actually they have no any strong noise cancellation features. And another irritating thing is touching system.. overall You can't use this product as friendly.
"In this boat product for ear are not comfortable, but it helps for outside worker like employees and professional candidates For middle class people waste of money on purchasing this product.This product battery life gives 3 to 4 hr only not 5hr and designing quality is not upto mark mostly not comfortable.I say don't buy it"
Please do not buy the product. There is a buzzing sound from the left earbuds. It doesn't stop. I can't even get a refund because there is no refund policy. I am replacing the item. I am afraid that i will get the faulty product again. 😞. PLEASE DONT BUY. Its the airdopes 441 pro.Edit: i have got the replacement and its working perfectly fine. Its been a year and its in brand new condition still.
"Too much Distortion. Frequent disconnections.Sent for repair 2nd time with in 3 Months.Qualify is not up to the mark.And for repairs, after raising the Req. It takes 10days for pick up and another 10days for replacement.Earpods were in transit which was morethan what I used till date."
"After few days of Usage, some unpleasant frequency noise coming from left side ear bud. When both ear buds are in idle Condition.Many user faced same issue. I think it's same kind of manufacturing defect.Apart from this issue, I loved its awesome BASS. Not much deep. But its great. Sound quality is good too."
These are probably just good for listening to music and nothing else.Too many defects and not at all practical.It's impossible to speak on call with these. The other person will just hear the background noise (even in a quiet environment) and very little of your voice.Sometimes the mic just won't get connected.Imagine listening from the earphones but speaking from your phone's mic!

 Sound Quality is superb. Bought it on Prime day sale with One day dilevery. Red color looking very much attractive. Noise cancellation is improved. If you want to buy airdopes then buy this one only..."
Worst product. The left earbud is defective as there is some static noise coming from it. Don't buy this product or you will regret after buying it. It is a manufacturing defect and its a major case with most of the people that the left earbud is defective. I replaced it two times then also after replacing the airdopes had same problem. Don't buy  it's worst product ever!
If we touch right side of the ear dopes it's attend the call ... Touch left to cut the call... Touch right to play next music.... Left to previous one.... Double tap to pause it.... Long press to access siri or ok google.... Remove it to release pain in ear ..... Thanks
"I purchased this product around in mid Jan for 2k (now it's available for 1.8k too) it was great in starting, but after 4-5  months the left side bud starting to get low sound and sometimes you'll have to adjust it while in podcase cuz it doesn't charge sometimes due to this it's batteryy dies very quick . It's only good for ppl who are base lovers and good for daily workout or even running activity. Fits perfectly in-ear no issue of falling. Only prob is with left bud"
The buds are quite good I used it for 6 months then the problems got started the battery life of my left earbud got degraded at that point that it just last long for 10 mins. And after that a month or so the right one also start to give 15 min or less listen time.I bought many headphones and earphone in past but this time it's not woyrt to buy this product can't recommend to any one.Boat please step up the game and increase quality in products.
"I just got this package today. First of all the delivery facility was really good. Even in this lockdown I received my package in 6 days outside the city. I've tested for sound, base quality. Both are great. Atleast at this range it is really awesome. The LEDs are so cool. With flashing green and blue lights. The touch control is quiet efficient and has a red LED for that. In pictures the case might seem big but it's so small and can fit in your pocket. I was worried at first about the calling facility. I've only tried that once. It was quiet good actually. There was no complaint for the person on the other side. It might not be as good outside. It has a good enough range to keep your phone at one place in a room. I've looked up about IPx7. It says this device will be okay being submerged under 3 feet or 1 m of water for 30 mins. *Don't try to test this. This is only to assure you that it can handle sudden rains and water splashes or sudden falling in water. So I think it's pretty good for the price we're paying. Again there is the case of noise cancellation. I'd say this one is pretty good in its work. I've been using boat products for 3 years now. I'm more than satisfied with the customer services by boat and the replacement facility. So if you want something like this just go for it. You'd be more than amazed..."
"Replaced the product due to sound quality issues in one earbud. After 1 month usage facing the same issue on the new pair as well. Battery charge is draining fast not even getting 10 hrs on full charge (including box).Update -- brought product 5 month back, replaced 1 time, and now the right bud is not working. Such a worst product!"
"1. Can't wear this for long, the ears become painful.2. You really have to be loud for the earpiece to detect your voice during voice call.3. There are continuous voice drop during call4. The battery backup is superb."
"Left Airdopes of 411 Pro started having a problem of poor battery backup after 20 days, I have been trying to call the support services for many times and I have been kept on hold for 6 mints and sometime 8 mints. Once the agent picks up the call they disconnect even without speaking. Finally I created a ticket (2155387) using support portal and uploaded Amazon invoice as well around 2:58 PM and by 4:01 PM I am getting a SMS stating that my warranty got expired. I bought it on 5th Feb 2021 and within 41 days warranty got expired? I am surprised... Please either replace the product or give my money back"
"Left Airdrop stop working just around return expired date and can't return product. So I have reached BoAt service center and raised 1844834 request, I got replacement with old Airdopes different colour. Then found extra pair with same both right side. Not atall help with BoAt Airdrops 441."
Right earphone stopped working in 2 months. After resetting it starts and auto disconnects in 10 mins.
Overall everything is nice but only problem is they dont blink while they connected to mobile bluetooth thts disapointing i purchase it for that blinking lights bcoz thts what attracted me to buy it but i love boat brand nd i am using more than 10 earphone of this same brand only bcoz of the sound quality and bass .i will suggested to everyone only if u r not tht intrested in tht lighting .
"I was excited to this product when i have ordered. However, after using it for 30 mins my ears started burning and paining alot. So, i decided to return it amd get refund then go with noise cancellation boat headphones.Postives:Good for music loversGood in battery back up and stylish lookNegatives:Not good for callingNot good for long time usage since it hurts u alot and at sometime u feel discomfort and gets crying too 🤣"
The sound quality is very good and the bass meets my expectations at this price range and the noise cancellation also works pretty well from the moment u plug in you get disconnect from the outside world......good product would definitely suggest it
"Good sound quality , Good Bass level . Battery good.Incoming phone call voice is not good and sounds like the opposite guy is speaking from  under water .  Not good for taking calls for long duration as voice is not good. Good for hearing songs"
Quality is very nice but don't like the design as it hurts the ears after 30 mins use.
Nothing new. Just the playback hours is more and rest all features are ok!Worst service by BOAT.I have replaced my product to boat since 1 side bud was not working in a month of time. I got the replaced product after two months and product looks like used one and not good sound clarity like the previous one.Don't buy it!
"Generally speaking, Boat's products are good however I feel cheated buying this product. The earbuds do not work if you are walking at a normal pace (with the phone in your pocket), the sound gets distorted and there are frequent drop in connections.If you stay in one place and want to listen to audio or are on a phone conversation, it works okay but it defeats the overall purpose of buying this.Please go for a different earbuds and you can give this a miss."
"Guys, it's a must-have product for all the tech geeks. Amazing built quality, clean sound. Bass is little enhanced. If you are a bass lover then just give it a try. I got this product in INR 1999. If you get this product in this amount, without any other thought just buy it. You will never regret it. :)"
There is a static noise in the left earbud and have ordered for an replacement unit.The replacement unit after two months again faulty. The right bud has hafl the volume of the left bud. Really disappointed with the quality.
This has least lag compared to other Airdopes . The bass quality is good compared to other Boat products.
I have planning to order these and finally ordered these.I took three days to reach at my home.The sound quality is good especially song and calling but I have observed that using single or mono airdope the mic quality decreases which is a bit bad and when you put it in your ear you can't hear anything from your soundings that's I don't know should considered disadvantage or not but otherwise the head phone literally dope.
The problem with the device is there's a issue when you coonect it for calls over social media (like whatsapp)....multiple applications not allowed to crossover volume....( Say you playing games on your pc....you can't use discord audio and your game audio on the device which was literally weird)All in all good earphones but when it comes to bluetooth and wifi connectivity together....it just fails like literally I give up and use the speaker instead...also there is a humming sound when you not listening to anything
"The only thing with which I'm disappointed is, even if you move little away from your mobile, the sound starts to break. If you move into another room, it almost stops. What's the point in using Bluetooth pods if we are having to carry the phone with us everywhere, even to the next room!"
By mistake I kept the right bud in shirt and added it to washing Machine. After wash cloth dried after 2days bud is really working great..
"Long battery is the best thing. The only problem i am encountering is I don't know why it doesn't connect with my computer, unlike it connects with mobile. I hv to remove the device and install it again. Further, one more problem is that again and again i have to reboot as no voice comes."
"I bought it on 10th May. It has been barely 15 days and the product has stopped working. The battery runs out in half hour and the buds connect to the mobile only when they are charging inside the box. The worst thing being, I am unable to return the product now as the return window is only open for 7 days. Big regret buying this product."
"Good one. I changes the ear buds gripper with spare small one since the big one was pain in ears, now it's fits perfectly. For workouts and rough use. Till have no problem from a month.Editing after a month use: Call quality is very bad. Can use only in a silent room. Even a small disturbance can distort call conversation. Good only for music."
"Sound quality is not good while on calls and connectivity issue is there. Voice breaking problem is there while on call. Bass is good. If using for only song purpose then it is fine, but for calls not."
"I have purchased 4 boat 441 airdopenot as good as shown in videos or discription..Bluetooth automatically disconnected after hearing song..you can not talk outside of room or public place with this eardope.,due to noise cancellation not provided...  I was very excited before buying this product but now i dint want this...."
"As always boat has been full of satisfaction for me. Loved these airdopes. The built quality is very good, multi light functions & the battery backup is excellent.Thanks amazon for always being best at delivery."
"What A Great Product By Boat, Boat 441:1700₹, Very Good Look, Sound Quality Is So Good and Very Nice Noise Cancellation, Very Very Good Bass Quality, Fit Completely In Ear, Go For It..."
"writing a review after 3 months usage1) highly disappointed by the call quality.the makers of this airdopes didnt think that people would actually talk using this. ypur voice is not hearable to the caller unless you shout. and if you are driving..u'll want to throw these away.2)i'd recommend to buy something actually useful.3) the sound quality is good, touch response is good overall appearance is good."
"HONEST 1 MONTH REVIEW. They last up to (3-7) days depends upon ur use..  Connectivity is lightning fast like before u insert them in ur ears they will be connected.. Bass, Noise cancellation, sound quality is very good.. Not good for calls while riding a bike(WITHOUT HELMET) which we never wear.. They were very comfortableand PERFECT FIT once I took the fins out.. TRY WITHOUT FINS."
"very bad mike, no noise cancellation feature, sound quality is ok, but it is very painful for long usage, please don't but it. if after reading this review you're going to purchase it then you are just wasting your money"
"Appalling experience. The sound quality is bad, it felt like I was listening to music at the lowest volume even when it was set to the highest range. Noise cancelling - it's joke that they claim it to have noise cancellation, it doesn't. Doesn't fit properly. Truly a unhappy and let down customer. I didn't expect this from Boat. I have a few other products from your brand which made me pick these."
All things are good but while driving a car or bike lot of disturbances..the voice other person I'm enable here..I don't know I receiveddamaged  product  or not..in normal times  it is working perfectly .hopefully understand the drawback and buy product
"Quality is good but they are uncomfortable to wear for long stretch of time.There's no return on this order, only replacement so I'm stuck with them.I should've bought ones that were designed like airpods, that design is comfortable."
Quality & sound wise very good. But chances of falling down while walking or in the journey is a draw back.Neckband is safe. Whenever you want you can put in ear and after use you can hang on you with neckband. But where as you can do like this with airdopes. You must carry charging case
"There's a static sound in left earbud which starts randomly and is very irritating while listening to music at low volumes, left earbuds have a slightly lower volume level as compared to right ones.Apart from this touch control is great, fit is the best I have ever got, I never seem to got it loose so far, battery life is good enough also it charges fast with the carry case and works well for me.Boat, please work on the design flaw of the static sound and replace for everyone those who got it, it's really irritating, expecting Boat to serve in the best way possible"
"Worst Bass Quality. There is frequent Glitch which can be heard. The Mike is worth 1Rs headphone. Calling is so bad, the other Peson is not even able to hear one word clearly. Even when the phone is in my hand even when am not moving. Not sure if I received a faulty product. Have ordered for a replacement. Update : Replacement has same issue."
"I would like to give you guys true feedback ,who are willing to buy this product .There is constant noise coming from left buds other than music like driver is making some noise of “signals or frequency” i don’t know but it coming continuously when the music or video is turned on..Sound quality is best and also it has good passive noise cancellation."
Its very disappointing n irritating how this product works on n off. Sound quality n other things are good but either of earbud stops working for minute or so n starts working again. Sometimes I even have to reset it to make it work. N the frequency of this happening is recurring that one can not even enjoy single song of 3 mins completely with both earbuds working properly. Its almost impossible. So just don't buy it. Its not worth it.
"The quality of the sound is very good,but material is very poor. I am facing connectivity issues like bluetooth is inside of its case but showing connected in my mobile.Tried to replace it but after replacement now replaced part having same issues."
It is a very good product. A quality indian brand product. I bought it for my friend and it was so good I recorded for myself..sound from both the earbuds while calling..
If you purchase only for listening music then it's very good. But if you using for calling purpose then don't buy this. For calling purpose you have to speak little louder than normal or sometimes you have to disconnect the call and speak using phone.Also when we talk on phone the voice get distracted. The front person not able to hear correct words else he said can you speak loudly.For calling I give 1 out of 5
"Everything is great, except that it doesn't sit tight in my ear, even though I'm using the smallest size... Can't use it when I walk or exercise. Only when I'm sitting in one place at home.."
I can say it's good. I don't find anything wrong with sound quality. Everything is working fine. It supports Google Assistant by tapping for 2 sec on left Side. But battery backup is average and after long use it causes pain in ear.
"It's a pretty good product. But it's not suitable for the ears. If you use it for more than an hour it starts to hurt your ears, because of its design. Not comfortable for the long run. I have tried all the combinations with the different types of ear caps they offered, but no use.*** Rest is good>> Battery backup is good both for charge case and ear-buds>> Sensitive touch controls (CTC)>> The sound quality is good over the calls also"
The headphones are nice and comfy and the sound quality is nice and it is comfortable for wearing and music quality the best thing about this headphones is that it is nice and they don't destroy the music quality by adding too much bass or being too loud which is common in this cost range I find this as quite good buy and am happy with it
"I ordered two of these. A black and a red variant. The black one was perfect. After a week i ordered the red one, but its case felt a bit brittle and had lesser finishing than the black one, also its insta wake n pair wasn't working. So just be a bit careful with yours and check it thoroughly upon recieving. If it has no issues then its perfect otherwise replace it ASAP. In terms of sound quality and other aspects, its really good."
"Nice cover, primium look, amazing bass..Battery backup is goodNoise cancellation is quite better and sound quality as compared to other earpods is too goodThe only thing I don't like is ears start paining if u wear it for long.."
Thr best TWS I Have ever purchasedBass-6/5(1 extra )Mids-5/5Highs-5/5Lows-5/5Pairing is fast AFBuild Quality is Plastic but feels premiumThe Led ring is very helpful in low light conditionsGot it for 1999/-The best value for moneyI am just in love with theseDon't think about it just buy it before it is too lateThanks for reading my review! 🙂😃
"One of the irritating product ""design"" I have ever seen.They have made the button as a touchpad. It's so sensitive. Even if your finger touch accidentally while scratching your ear. That's it. It stops the play. If you accidentally touch it for more than 2 seconds it switches off the one earpod. Adding fuel to it! If you are on call, Never even scratch your ear. then rest is history. It cut the call. You have to call them back. :(When it comes to quality and music. It's awesome. I really recommend the boAt team to consider fixing the design of the product. The music quality was amazing. :D Accurate!! Noise cancellation !! everything is perfect..."
Amazing sound quality. In a very good price.Just love th bass in it and the sound quality.Best airdopes I have ever seen. Thank you for reading my review
The Air quality is balanced.  The playback time and case backup together is pretty good. Seems like a decent purchase for The sale price.NOTE: body not recommended to be used as a powerbank unless essential.  Which was one of the USP for buy this device so a little bummer.The flip cover of the case feels a little fragile.NOTE : Within two Days I started hearing this hissing noise from the left ear bud.  Its pretty madding.
Great purchase. Case is handy n sturdy. Buds fitting is good. Buds are not at all bulky. Can be used as emergency power bank for the mobile using c type charging cable as it has usb port.C type port is given so no need to carry different cable for mobile n headphones.
"very bad quality, with in one week  , my 441-yellow  is not working,.Upon raising the request, they replaced a cheaper/wrong item which 411-black.  Then I raised the request, it took 22 days and no response yet.I used it for 2 days and I bought it on July 9th. So after 2-3 months also, I haven't had the chance of using it.No proper customer service.  You will get no responses.Their courier service sucks. From telangana to Mumbai, they take 1 month to ship back and forth.Don't fall for it."
"The noise cancellation is patheticWhile ON, it gives a beep noise in one of the buds which is very irritating. It's pure NOISE.I tried to replace it with boat support, but again they sent me a similar peice which has the same issue. Pathetic support! I wish Boats could take this up further."
"I have brought these boat airdrops 441 for 2000rs from deal of day . The brought promises to fit comfortably in our ears  , but after 1 week of use , my ear pains.Secondly,  the battery backup is very less . It's not suitable for longer use .Thirdly , there is connection and technical problems with this product. Sometimes left ear pods are disconnected abruptly and don't connect with phone .Not worthwhile for better and comfort listening."
Overall i love the quality. As i have read all the reviews.My opinion :These arrived in perfect condition.About 80% noise cancellation.Bass and audio quality 80%.For calls i will say these are okay (they do the job)4/5. Thankyou
"1. Quite good look2. Better noise cancellation, good base.3. Quite lighter, fixes in the ear well4. Inspite having bluetooth 5.0, Doesn't connect to two Device at same time."
Worse airpods everBakwas productPrice is too high for its because its sound quality is worse and also it create some discomforts while wearing. And i do not like these airpods ever please dont waste money on these airpods
"Its a nice product,why the negative reviews exist i dont know.If reviewing the overall product-Case quality is nice mat black .The airdopes are so comfortable to the ears.The bass is good.thumping bass.But with the sound u can use the equaliser because i am not that much satisfied with the sound quality its average.The touch function works great .Noise cancellation is super.no problem to the other person .But it is not 100 percent regarding the price.but it is truely wireless atlast so something may be missing.I will give 4 rating."
BoAt rocks as always...... Got one day delivery and was nicely packed. About the sound performance i would day one of the best way to use and light n comfortable. Though i found the noise cancellation was poor but any how this budget provides you more then expected from boAt side
"It really sucks that after 2 weeks, the left side of the airdope stopped working and Amazon is a major sucker in this as they're not replacing it and neither they're willing to escalate this to boats.That's so excruciating."
Sound is good...... But it picks up every minute sound in ur vicinity.... Even 10m away.... N ur voice is less heard by the other person!!! One has to literally scream or go to n isolated place to talk..... Worse.... If u switch on active noise cancellation on the app.... The other person cannot hear anything from u!!!! These make gud headphones.... Not mics!!!

 Pros: first of all good pricing1. Nice design, feels good in hands.2. Good battery backup about 4 hour on a single charge.3. It adhere steadily in ears.4. Passive noise cancellation is good in room.5. IP X7 dust & splash resistant.6. Deep bass7. RGB lighting is lit8. Touch control is responsive.9. Mic is clear.Cons:-1. Sound quality at 100% is lightly rasping not clear.2. No volume control by touch.3. Slightly high noise during calling.4. Hinge of the case is not reliable.Update: After one year Battery Backup reduced 2.5 hours, Alas!"
"I didn't like it, there is weird sound when connecting to laptop and I am unable to use it for calls.People at the other end isn't able to hear me. I think I got a defective product.Noise cancellation doesn't work"
"Sound is good, connection is good. With macbook mic sound is not working properly but biggest negative for me is if I take call on street, all of the road noises like bikes etc is enhanced along with voice for the person listening at the other end."
Good product sound quality was also good.. Spl bass.. Good thumping bass... Its all depend which cell phone ur useing... Music trackCase.. Durability is goodEasy to use one time pair onlyHappy with productRecommended to buy others.Thank u..
"I ordered the same for my son. He said that it is really good, having great sound effect. Item delivered within 18 hours after order."
"First of all I bought it for 1800 rupees,considering with that price it is the best under 1800 to 2000 rupees.but with the normal price it is good product not the best I would say. it has good sound quality,average bass,sometimes one airdope gets disconnected with Bluetooth which annoys you sometimes,build quality is good,it fits good in ears, comfortable for long time on ears,If you get it for 2500 and less than that go for it...or else search other products"
"This device is good for using with mobile phone but totally useless for laptop use. When I use it to make calls using laptop, the other party cannot hear the voice. I also got it replaced with same device  but the issue still persists. Tried with other laptops too. :("
"Budget TWS. Sound quality is clear and bass is above average. The CTC has a lag of 1 second but that's because touch controls mainly require to process it for the counts of touch. Comfortable 100%. Fits just right and you won't feel it after 5 mins. Proper fit makes it hard to fall of the ear even while exercising.  Connectivity is about 10m, from one room to other. After that it pauses and resumes automatically. Build quality is good. 'IWP' feature saves time as pods are ready to use out of the box anytime.Overall 8/10."
It's really really amazing..sound is perfect... connectivity is very good..and fits perfectly in my ear.. doesn't move even on sudden head movements...strong build quality..I bought the red ones which look so cool..and it's so affordable...I am loving it.. definitely would recommend this to others for an all in one package! ❤️
Doesnt sit properly in ears.. slips off most of the times. The other person cant hear properly even after being so loud on calls. Its like i had to scream to make them hear me out clear. Noise cancellation is zero. The other person in call can hear my surroundings but not my voice. I felt its just waste of money. As its just lying at home doing nothing. I was so interested to buy n bought it. But not even a week i felt its waste and lost my interest using it.
"not that great ,, other functions besides the music are not functioning properlythose who are bass lover for its ok but even bass is not that clear,, this product should be under Rs-1000/"
I shown you the all perspective of this product is worthless at this priceAll perspectives like:  The battery case of this Airdopes.  The Airdopes  Inner perspective of the battery case to recharge your Airdopes battery  Specifications are:  Input - DC 5v/2a  Earbuds battery - 3.7V/ 35mAh  Charging case battery - 3.7V/ 500mAh And type c charging wire.And I am use this product since 2 month. Still that is impressive.  That is not sponsored review of this product.
"For Bassheads the is best earbuds this is for those who like boom boom type of music. Because of this boom the mids and vocal are not that clear. And if u like to listen music on high volume then this is not that great pick the volume is not that loud. The loudness is okish. In department of calling, thease earbud perform average. If u are in silent area  the mic is  very well and good. But if u are in little bit of noisy area the mic quality is simply not ok. And of u kind of guy who pick up calls on bike then there is big no from my side. Only in silent area the mic is good, otherwise the mic is below averageVerdict :-  This is only for boom boom type of music listners and who take calls in silent area that's it."
"I thought it would be a nice pair of earphones with good sound quality and battery life but was highly disappointed. I have already replaced these once but both times the product I recieved was faulty. One earphone would just switch off while the other still has about 80% of it's battery left. Never seen a worse manufacturing of a product, that too from a reputed company like boat. Waste of money as I can't use the earphones anymore with just one earphone that is working. And there is no way to replce it again. Don't buy it, it's not worth your money."
"PROS* Best sound quality at this price range* Best noise cancelling you can get at this price range* Perfect fit.- does not fall off even while jogging* Portable - fits in your pocket, can be carried anywhere* Microphone is not badCONS* After a few months of use, the left ear airdope discharged very quickly. This happened to my friend too, but a replace for the product was accepted."
"It's decent overall and quite good for the price with it's low-key noise cancellation and nice sound. But when connected over a zoom call, one of the earbuds keeps on losing connection. Happens only during calls though. Never happened while watching or listening something"
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I used this product for 3 months and then suddenly the volume went too low. This is a common issue noted in boat products...beware!I registered a complaint and in replacement they sent me the same product which i'd returned. I registered a complaint once again and again they sent me a defective product with same issue.Since then i've been constantly following up with Boat team over email and Instagram page, however it has now been 2 months but not resolved."
Product quality is super. Very amazing product to cut off noise from outside and also sound will not heard by the others even at high volume. Perfect design. But not so happy with bass.but still deserve 5 rating
"Short Review:I am a music lover, Bought This For Workout and study sessionsFit-5/5Bass-4.5/5 (6mm driver, in wired i use sony 12mm driver earphones)Connectivity-4/5Bulky- 3/5( which means neither too big nor too small)Battery-9/5( superb)If you have a medium budget, get this straight!Otherwise Go For Sony XM true wireless"
"So I bought this product in october'20. It worked fine for an entire week. Then one of them stopped connecting. Then the other one started showing problems with the sound output. I registered a complaint with BOAT on their website. It took them 13 days to pick it up, check it and replace it with a new one. I sent the product to them along with the box, all accessories and documents. What came back was a used old product in a bubble wrap! No box, no accessories, no documents, not even the warranty card!! Imagine my surprise!!!Absolutely unprofessional!! BOAT just might have the worst after sales service in the world!! And belive me...you'll certainly need it withing a month of purchasing it!!"
"good product,  have good sound quality,  have a impressive range of Bluetooth so true wireless,  battery life is surprisingly very long, just charge and forget because it will last very long, only problem is size of its case, slightly large, in my opinion size can be reduced slightly and there will be no major effect on battry life found by anyone."
This is a nice product in the price.
"Amazon sent me defective Airdopes. It was not showing me the option in my Bluetooth to connect it...Neither it was getting switched on. And when I placed the replacement for the defective Airdopes then without even calling me or coming to my place, the delivery guy mentioned ""Delivery failed"". I need my replacement product otherwise I will be going to the consumer court for this and will be taking a legal action against you guys....just wait nd watch"
Very very poor noise cancellation. Sound quality is good and bass is actually it's usp. Also connectivity issues happen once in a while. Also one con is that it can connect to one device at a time while products priced lower then this also support 2 device at a time.
Really very awesome TWS headphones. Very very comfortable and very good fitting. Sound quality is too good as i had seen so many TWS but this is one best all of them. Bass is very very good. Lite weight. Huge fan of Boat.
Just bought bcz of Indian brandStarting it was good but later on am facing problem with right airdope it sounds like a bee for sometime when not in use.For calling it is not at all good.If u get this product within 2.5k then nly buy otherwise go for different one.Charging is good that is the only positive thing.
Sound is getting interrupted in mean while watching YouTube. The air dopes are not connecting when removed from case. Again I need to turn off and turn on bluetooth. I didn't expect this from a company like boat.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 So the left earbud is not working after the usage of after the use of 10 months and I am highly disappointed with the quality of these earphones I am was very excited for the earphones but they turns out to be very bad quality the left earbud stopped working which is terrible I am high disappointed I would like to get them repair. We would like a replace  this if possible please help us its would be great"
The build quality and the fit is perfect however this particular earphone has absolutely no quantity of sound. Overall one of the Boat product that could shut the company down. The boat Airdopes 441 is the worst earphone I have ever tried wired/wireless in terms of quality of sound
"Boat never dissappoints you be it wired or wireless. Airdopes 441 TWS are as good as Boat's any other wired earphones. Battery life could've been better (I get easily aorund 3-4 hours on continue online lectures and 1 hour of music). Also like to mention, left bud returns somewhat more battery than right one. Other than that sounds amazing, fits properly and don't fall off even if you're doing heavy workout."
"This is my first tws!!Had a very good experience with this!!!To talk about the plus points,This has a very clear audio quality,pairs up too quick...The led lights are awesome!!!!Touch guestures are too reactive and smooth!!The yellow colour looks cooler!!!I was actually shocked to see the size of the case.. It's not as huge shown in the pictures,but very compact which makes it quite easy to fit in the pocket 😃The type c cable helps in fast charging which is one of the highest features of this tws ranking higher than all other tws under 5k..The ear wings make it stiff in the ear which prevents it from falling..The design, build and fitting is truly top-notch..The battery life lasts little longer than 3 hours and case can recharge around 3 times fully and litlle in the 4th time..To talk about the cons:Only few cons though,Truly not suitable for gaming as it does not have a low latency mode compared to redmi or realme buds..The earbuds must be kept properly in the case or else it won't charge 😂There are 3 magnets in the earbuds but only 2 in the case which makes it funny!!!I think I have only such points to talk about and I will update along with the usage.."
Good product if you're looking for a earpod at a smaller budget. Headphones are one of those things whose quality scales with price and the difference is pretty visible (audible?). These are good for this price point.
"✓Sound quality perfect 9/10( best sound experience during dolby Atmos activated)✓Good Bass 10/10 ( if feeling more than use Equalizer )✓connectivity also great, i had connected 4 devices and it connects smoothly✓ Noise cancellation not on upper side but its okay at this price range✓ Till now no issue related to calling✓ Overall great product. Go for it"
"first one had a terrible static in right ear unit, replacement had very poor distorted connectivity on phone calls (1st one was fine in this regard). Overall, a product that doesn't satisfy all expectations it promises to fulfill. Not my recommendation."
I am writing the review after using this for a week.Sound quality is ok.Noise cancelling is good.Bass is average.Call quality/ voice quality is good.Negative things.When you are on the call.if you try to adjust the ear bud..the call gets disconnected once ur finger touches the earbud . Its very sensitive.And you will not get / hear call ringtone on the ear bud..when you receive the call.the ear buds does not shows any sound or ringtone sound.it be ideal..that is major minus. When you keep your device on bag.during the driving you will not hear the ringtone on the earbuds.
"Everything you heard about this product is damn true. It's amazing!! And that baaasssss! That's the boat's signature. Sound is crystal clear. If you're bass lover, This is for you."
"I'm here to review after using 5 months.I am desperate with battery life, it's too much less as boat claim. I can have on 45-60 minute battery life from 4-5 hours that boat claim. I don't want it at all.Please don't go for it, there are so many other options, go for that."
The product is so good the sound quality and evrything. And it's very comfortable. And they said it had 3 mics and it gives a best call quality but the mic is not soo good others can't hear me properly in my meet calls and phone call. Other than that the product is good and worth the price but just one thing that mic kaa thing it would be nice if they fix it for others. Overall I give 4/5 for this product.
"Loved these pairs of airdopes from boat. Sound quality is awesome as always experienced with boat. Value for money. Only drawback is these airdopes do not have volume control, rest all features are great. It is definitely worth purchasing."
"Before buying this product ,I used many year bud ,but not satisfied by anyone. But it is amazing if you charge one time 3 to 4 days you don't want to charge  and it fix perfect in our year. I recommend every one to go for this."
"Great product. Sound quality is immersive while listening to music. When paired with dolby atmos, just a grab a popcorn, a drink and a sofa. I listened too 8D and bass boosted music to test and it passed of course. I won't comment on noice cancellation, although it was pretty good(I don't care about that). Simple controls for accepting/rejecting calls, mobile assistant and other features are good. Resistance to water splashes also passed. So, thanks boAt.So, 5 STARS from my side.🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Red looks a lil artificial like a toy and in 11 days of use one side is not charging and something is off with the container box or may be the buds, not connecting to a new device, cant even reset coz its not connecting to the box (right side bud. Cant replace it with any other colour or even return it, so buy carefully. Though when they were working they are really cool specially the sound is amazing and touch response too."
Overall this is a good product but not recommended for long use. Ther ear aches after couple of hours because of the fitting position of these buds.
Reviewing The BoAt Airdopes 441 TWS After using from 6 months Where In Lighting Deal I Bought it for 1.6kIt is price worthyGood Sound qualitySpecifications are at its peakOverall#killingperformance #rockingbassquality
This is the best one I have bought. This is masaba black star one. Looks soo stylish. And bass is just wow. I was waiting for this one to get back on stock and I ordered it then and there. Got it in one day. Writing review after using one day.
"Im using this product and its the best ever airpods I've ever used!!Itd worth the money, no issues in this product!!The sound quality is better than the wired earphones. And it stays connect even if we move far away from phone!!The touch was so handy..that doesn't interrupt by unknowing touches.The bass was awesome!! no distortion while in call. And im satisfied with this product."
"Strictly not suitable for gaming, the manufacturer did not provide any info on latency of audio. upon using for sometime the latency observed is almost 0.25s which is annoying and it doesnt have the low latency aptX tech...the device although is  connected but theres no audio which we were unable to resolve...just amediocre device with overprice"
"Sound Signature: Loud & Bass heavySound Clarity: AverageEar Comfort: Not comfortable if you are using for more than 30minsEar Fittings: Well fitted, you can do jogging with airdopesBattery Life: GoodIssue: Left earpiece stops producing sound very frequently but if the music is paused & played again then it works normally again."
"Good purchase bought on a deal for 2k Everything is good,but the left ear bud is making some kind of noise though not bothers me a lot, quite large in size also got ear pain after continuous usage, The Bluetooth radius in practical will be around 5 meters only.Still recommendable in this price range with good audio quality and battery backup"
"I ordered them after seeing the good reviews on Youtube, but the left earbud was not connecting even after full charge. I applied for a replacement, but this time both the earbuds are not connecting. And even the factory reset does no good to the situation. Highly disappointed! I was not expecting such a bad experience from such a big company.I do not recommend these earbuds to anybody. There are so many better earbuds at this price range."
"Purchased this Earphones in 2020 Nov and been using it for a year. No specific issues with the device, it's working fine, charging up quickly and as battery runtime upto 2:30 hrs (maximum extent I have used the earphone, when I switched off its stood at 10% battery). I am regular user of this headset and its fits well in my ears and feel comfortable. Controls are touch sensitive and you have to be careful while handling it."
"I liked it but the only thing was when I bought it, it was not working well.But then I have got it replaced by amazon (Thanks to amazon) with a new one.And the new one is working good. My overall experience is good with the airdopes,but I think little bit of voice quality improvement would have been great for onlinemeetings."
The product is not that good. Have bought it about a month back but there seems to be issues with charging. Sometimes. Only one of the two gets charged and only one works. On some occasions both get charged but the battery on one dies out before other. Outside the return period to might have to buy new ones
"First of all boat product is very nice .but in this product have some pros and cons.From the first look, it looked very nice. I bought the blue color.After few minutes it started hurting in my ear.The fitting is not much good, depending on the size and their comfort.it is connecting very fast .Music lovers may not appreciate this, as it does not have enough bass quality.They Charging Case is also very nice looking.The noise cancellation is not there at all.There are much better than a few of similar products available in this range."
"Given the price this is pretty awesome in every aspect. Battery life, fit, quality etc.My only complaint is in the noise cancellation.This doesn’t have active noise cancellation, what it does is when you wear it, due to the very tight fit in the ear it will cut you off from the surroundings which can turn out dangerous if you are on the road or something.On the other end the tight fit helps with the bass which is genuinely perfect."
The product is absolutely amazing...super bass and amazing hd sound quality. Many were complaining that they were facing problem while taking in a call...but I didn't face any problems while talking to someone....amazing earbuds in this price range...very much satisfied with the product. And thanks to amazon service for a quick delivery within 18 hours...Would be updating more after using it for a few days
"Worth buying for 1699/- Flash sale. Used for 15  days, bang for the buck. Not recommended to hear volume at 100%[Some white noise]. 80-85 % volume sound is clear."
The Bestest earbuds. Super Sound quality. 👌Super bass. Noise cancellation should be improve. Averall Super.... Not wasted my Money. I liked this product very much😊. Perfect fit for my ears.
"I got this for my son and he is a big music head. The sound quality is Prestine , the bass is way to good , just need to do some tweaks using the Equalizer which is inbuilt in the phone and you are good to go.Perfect fit , doesn't even feel heavy in the ear and doesn't cause itching or any pain. Good overall build quality and proper stability over calls as well."
I am using this for 1 year.. Starting its battery performance was amazing.. But since last few months earbuds battery and charging box battery is draining very fast.. And one more main problem i faced since bought that noise cancellation.. But i adjusted with that.. But now a days tge biggest problem is battery draining.. Its lasting 30 min only.. Some time less than that... Never expect this from boat... So i want to search another company..
Amazing sound quality. When you watch movies you feel like you are watching theatre and amazing bass. Love this earbuds. I recommend all. Never thought boat will blast like this. Will buy soundbar now of this brand only👍👍. I havent tried noise cancellation yet. Because that is not important for me.
"The left earbud has a static sound going on always.When I pause any video or music I hear that sound.At start, I was able to ignore the sound but later on it started getting very much irritating.But the overall quality n built is very gud.I've placed a replacement, , I hope I get a proper item this time.UPADTE 20AUG - Got a replacement for the same but the replacement item has more static sound from the left ear bud. It's very irritating.AIRDOPES 441 PRO very disappointing product."
"I found the the sound quality bis a bit low on these ear-buds. Noise cancellation is also less but for the price they are very good and work for a long period on a single charge.For what I use them for they are good, I mostly use them for calls and listen to some music."
"It never gets switched off. Not charging in the case until I connect to charger. Automatically connects to mobile, superceding other bluetooth device already connected to the phone. It's rubbish."
"They are pretty good if you want to listen to music and just attend calls indoors.If used for longer than an hour they warm up a bit.The quality of plastic isnt that great, and looks like a toy.  Also pains a little, giving headache if worn for a longer time. I might stick to wired ones and switch to these if absolutely needed"
"It's usable if you only need to listen to music. But if you have to attend calls, it's practically useless. It's mic is worse, or ain't there at all. Other person just can't hear you at all. You would need to turn the BT off, and use device's speaker and mic only. I have used 2 more products from Boat and they were good. But not this one."
"Excellent product from boats. The connection, sound clarity, bass quality are wonderful. No doubt about it. And specially the battery power is outstanding. I couldn’t use it continuously more than hour as it begins to hurt my ears."
Got it for 1999 rupees.Product quality is good.Battery life is descent.Earbuds and case heat up while charging which is annoying.The earbuds fit nicely in my ear.Sound- vocals are clear. Lows and mids are good. Highs are above average. BUT TOO MUCH BASS.overall sound quality is good.Go for it If you get a deal for 2000 or less
"I ordered this product after reading many reviews and most of them told that its not useful for calling purposes. This was quite true, its been 3 days that my product has arrived and I am getting problems with calling. As the microphone is in our ears and not near out mouth, our sound to the other person echos and is heard from a distance. So I have to talk louder which is not possible everytime. Even then the sound echos. Rest of the features like noise cancellation and bass quality is upto the mark but honestly that is not my main concern. I bought it for recording youtube videos. I didnot consider the reviews as I am not much into calling and bought it because it came at a fair price. But if you wanna buy this do consider that it is not good for calling purpose what so ever."
"Simply superb ...just loved it ,Sound quality is very good , music lover enjoy the pure sound , noise cancellation also very best , suggestions is use only one bud in driving , bass quality is amazing ,no doubt at all , change phone music settings also .."
There is no Noise Cancelling In the device. At This Price Point You Can't Expect A Noise Cancellation. The Built Is Very Much Good. But U Can't Use for Long Duration It Hurts It Ears Due to the ear hooks. I get a battery Around For 3hrs in 80%Volume
"Well,I like the sound quality.Not much of a user as I don't have time to listen to music as I am busy running after my toddler.However it has a firm grip on the ear.Doesnt fall off easily."
Terrible product. Left earpod is not working. Just on boarding big stars will not create a brand. Very bad battery backup. Poor noise cancellation. To copy is a measure but to copy so pathetically is an art which can only be mastered by BOAT.
Hei I am use this for 1mnth and now I can't use the product . This device have problem that if connect with your mobile and then if u connect this with ohr mobile it's doesn't get reconnected wid the 1st one andost importantly service team is list bother about the problem 😡😡😡😡
"I'm not saying that this product have best sound quality or best bass quality and is good option for noise cancellation but as i got it for 2k, it's proved to be very useful.perfectly fit, literally good charging (both case and buds) and will work for nearly 4 hoursVery good option for first budget buds to buy"
"1. Bass quality is ok. Neither too low or neither too high.2. Biggest disadvantage is, if you connect this with smart tv, volume control is not there to reduce or increase volume. Tv remote control doesn't work to control volume on these airpods.3. Not recommended to use it for taking calls for business purpose."
"Battery life works very very well, its been 10 days since I charged it's case and I use it daily for about 3 hours and the case only dropped 2 out of 4 charging points.If you were using any good quality wired earphones before this, you might find volume of these airdopes somewhat less than those, audio clarity is as same as the wired ones. Bass is very heavy and can be compared to wired to some extent. If you are wishing to go for running or any physical activity and need an tws, definitely go for these.😊"
"First of all go for the smaller battery one because the smallerSound is excellent , bass is overwhelming and connectivity is impressive, totally in awe of this productPrefer the smaller battery one because the battery backup is actually so good that I didn't felt the need of charging it more than single time a week"
the product boat airdopes 441 had to be returned on the first day itself.the problems i faced:1.there was a pricking sound in the left earbud2. call quality was extremely poor3. my ears started to pain after 30 mins of continuous use which i did not face previously to the airdopes 201.please do not purchase this model
"Sound Quality was QUITE GOOD but the Left EarBud started buzzing on PAUSING MUSIC or in the interval between two SONGS. There is NO NOISE CANCELLATION (which was not expected either, FALSE CLAIM). So I went for a REPLACEMENT because of the BUZZING and they in return delivered a USED PRODUCT with the MANUFACTURER'S SEAL BROKEN and EARWAX in the Buds! So this RATING for this PATHETIC experience with these EarBuds!"
"I bought this product on 24th feb. 2020. I have been using it since then. However, the left bud seems to have a charging issue. After putting it in the case, it is not getting charged. I really dont know as return window is closed now. It should not happen, my expectations have doomed completely now."
"Battery draining is too fast, only able to use for few hours, disappointed.Atleast 10hrs should have been good !! But No."
ProsGood sound quality and bass is good tooBattery life same as mentionedGood fit remove wings for more comfortable fitConsMic is not that good for online conversation like classes or callsAfter a month of use left earbud discharges 20 mins before right earbud(tries charging both fully by leaving them in fully charged case overnight but no avail)
"Very very bad product, sound quality is very bad,There is a good imbalancing problem. No matter what you do, it does not change. If you are lucky you will get good stuff. Most people say bad review. And the latency problem has gotten better. In my opinion this product is not  good"
"It's been just a 15 days and I hardly used it and battery is performing worst.  Also the charger box is perfectly fit to charge the ear buds. Sometime just get disconnect while and call and without any notification, eventhough when battery is full.  Didn't expect this worst thigns so soon"
"Please Please PleaseNever Go with this product.I am using since Feb -2021 and is suddenly stopped working after 2 months. Trying since last month to contact with Amazon,Seller, Boat but no on responding. I have never seen such type of service. I am associated with amazon since 9 years they are not listening. Escalated many times.Worst ever product. If there is no star option I would give 0 out of 5 star."
"1 star cause 0 isn't possible.I had so much hopes from these Boat Airdopes, I have been using Boad Headphones/Earphones since last 3-4 years. This is the first time I feel so pissed.Bought 441 pro on prime day sale. After 1 week of use right airdopes are draining like what in 1 hour and also has light blink issue. The left one has really some cracking noice which starts after 3-4 days of use. Clearly some manufacturing defect."
"The product is beat in the price range, the bass, the quality of sound,  the design, everything is just perfect. I would recommend the product 11 out of ten. Literally switched into NIRVANA."
"I am not a big fan of earphones nor I spend much. While I ordered Airdopes 441, I wasn't expecting much I just needed wireless stuff for workout. But trust me it's far better than what I expected, as this range it's superb. Go for it without a doubt.Sound quality is awesome, bass is also wonderful, noise cancellation is not upto the mark though."
"1. Good sound quality.2. Passive noice cancellation. You can't hear out side noise. Not recommended while while vehicle use or while walking.3. During call, receiving party complaining of to much background noise.4. Good bass quality.5. Pain in and around ear in prolonged usage.Rest all a good product."
Its a fantastic product... i am a boat user from last 6 years... but unfortunately this products..... the right ear buds stop working from today.... and the amazon return facility is also closed.... dont know what to do.... i dont want refund ... i want replace.... bcoz i love the product..... its really nice.... pls help
Charging case of airdopes was defective from the first day. It could not get charged. I haven't applied for return because my address was being changed continuously since then.So in one sentence very bad experience with this product. Why do you supply defective products? I think it was deliberate. I am giving you one star only because I can't give minus five.
"Worst TWS from boat .....after one month only the left bud stopped working....I took it to service centre they gave me replacement piece that too after 20 days of waiting, also an unsealed one like it could have been a used one and honestly this one looks like they gave me duplicate cheap piece in terms of quality.Dont purchase any of the Boat product which is more than 500rs. They cant manage the quality above this price bracket.*Worst aftersales Service*"
First of all its best for the bass lovers. It do consist the lows and mids but the depth is not that strong but u cant blame boat  for that because with 6mm drivers you are getting the beast so ill say go for it. You'll be impressed really soon. For me lime color was my favourite.
"Depends on what you are about to use them for! They are good only for music, Nothing else! No noise cancellation whatsoever. Calls are the worst, bass is good low is just fine and treble is fair!On calls you can here the person on call but the other person will bearly understand what you say because more ambient noise will be heard! Don't buy them! Please save yourself some money and get better ones!!!!!"
"Everything about this is good the only problem I experience is that it sometimes has connection issues (not sure why), but it's like 1-2 times in 2 weeks.The earpiece battery stays for around 4.5 hrs. But overall I am satisfied"
"The sound quality maybe good but the build quality is third class. My first product was faulty. It was not getting charged. Then I asked for replacement. The replaced, new product also has the same issue. I found out boAT products don't last long."
My 1st impression after listening sound. It's awesome deal with this price labelsBass-🤘Terrible-🤘Vocal-🤘No found any distortion in 100% volume.Need to check mic quality and noise cancellationWill give feedback on this after after 1month
Awesome.But my left airdope is making buzzing sound even I replaced it but still the new one is also making same noise. The noise can be heard when music pauses or track changes.
At first it started to give a annoying noise then after some time the airdopes charging case started not to detect airdopes.At last I am unable to charge it and a more annoying noise comes when I hear music.what a piece of crap Amazon has sent me!
"The product is good, the only issue is battery backup. In one charge it hardly work for 45 minutes."
"The design seems strange and inconsistent. Response to touch and tap is inconsistent. Very often there's a lag between left and right. If you move your head or tilt, one of the two stops streaming audio. It fits perfectly in the ear but the technical difficulties make this unbearable. Better to shell out a bit more and buy a trusted brand. I used to think this was trustworthy! Rather disappointed."
Worst earphones ever don't buy them I bought it because they were new and price was low and watched youtube videos about this product and everyone lied about it saying it's best but no honestly it's worst it's supposed to be having 5 hours battery backup but the right earpiece has some Sought of problem and it goes dead after 2 hourse and the left earpiece works for 5 hours straight bad earphones never ever buy them!
Very bad call reception. Almost every caller complained that they hardly can hear me or the audio was breaking. Got replaced the first buy but the second one too disappointed. Hence returned the product and requested for refund. Music lovers can still continue to buy and best part is the design of this device it sits comfortably in the ear and sits firm too. Does not slip or fall off until wrongly used or accidentally pushed off the ear
Received empty and torned seal box. Someone take out the Airpods and out additional tape over it.Not expected with Amazon. Really bad experience for the fisrt time though I am a prime member since long time.

 I have used this product earlier also indifferent color and gifted someone, now I bought this black for me and I’m facing problems like sometimes  not charging after keeping in box, discharge to early , sometimes low voice need to be returned or exchanged. I’m not sure do I need to visit service center or someone from Amazon will take away"
Worst in the case of calling functions (sound quality is very worst)..I guess it was designed for only hearing the songs through BT and it is not fit for these calling options. Because it often get disconnected while in call and the opposite person on the call couldnt hear what I speak (there were some sound/noise throughout the call) and quality was poor. Idk whether i have received defective quality or not but I didn't expect this from BOAT. Overall sound quality in call feature is not at all good
"Whenever I put these airdopes surround sound is too low if someone talking to you then u need to pull one from your ear otherwise u won't hear the clearly.That's good for noise cancelling but nit for daily use definitely l.Pro : sound is amazing, quality is good and durable been using it since a week.Call quality is amazing too.Con: Sometimes get buzz sound, noise cancelling and pain in ears 👂"
"Overall the ""sound quality"" is very very good excellent product the sound quality is amazing and battery life is so much amazing that I don't need to charge for weeks the problems i faced is for ""noise cancellation "" it scores 1off 5 they should add that and touch is very sensitive like anything touches it would end the call even on adjusting the earphone while on a call would cut it rather than these 2 everything is perfect keep evolving !  ""Bass equality"" is crazyly good"
"This is a good earbuds in this price .It has good bass , sound quality and noise cancellationBut in calling , this is not even close to averageWhether you are in peaceful environment or bustling city . In quite environment your voice will echo to opponents mobile and in loud environment you cant understand a thing ."
"I dont know if this is a problem with the product itself, or with mine in particular, but I noticed very recently that the mic wasnt working at all, and it has been using my phone onboard mic this entire time! And ive bought it last year, so no returns possible obviously"
This pair is really nice for this price. The only problem which I faced with this earbuds is that their sensor is too sensitive and they start playing music or videos even when u try to put them on.  That’s a major problem according to me. Other then that they r a nice pair of earbuds
"*They are a good fit for your ears*The range is also good.*Sound could have been a bit crisp as the base overpowers the vocals, but overall it’s good.*The surface of the earphones is touch contolled, so during a call if I mistakenly touch the earphones for adjustment in my ear, the call will disconnect which is pretty annoying."
"Sound quality is good. But it is very base heavy. Sound quality is very clear but you dont get sound isolation very well. Also, if you generally speak softly, you may face difficulties during a call. Awesome connectivity and unbelieveable battery life and a snug fit (with the right size of eartips)Overall, a good quality product."
"Just got the item delivered to me. Prompt delivery by Amazon as usual... Product quality feels to be on the inferior side, but worth it at its price... fits in the ear snugly and no risk of falling down even with aggressive movement...sound quality is good, but the bass effect is a bit overpowering... would recommend to others...Update: used for 2 months... now one earpiece is spoilt.. can only use 1 side... warranty is very hard to claim... service not that good"
They tend to fall out of my ears sometimes but otherwise very good product.Good Battery Life
Best product at this price. I have JBL headset before that but really I appreciate this Indian company to compete with branded items like JBL. Must buy. Bass is better than JBL.

 I like this airdrop. I was looking for this kind of such best airdrop for me. And finally I got it. Best sound quality, bass and calling. Noise cancellation working fine. Overall best product. 2600 Mah battery.Thanks"
"The boat earpods 441 are good in sound quality....pairing....bass....primium quality of material,fast connecting,hand free calling, steroid calling,secuure canal fit alll day in ear,no pain of putting,but only one negative is the touch sensor is responding 2seconds lately. And noise cancellation is ok...... except that all functions of these eardops are awesome....... finally the product is so good to buy....."
"Sound quality is great. But my ears are hurting after sometime, they are huge. U can't wear a helmet with this. Compared to mi earbuds bass and sound quality is good, mi earbuds look premium than this product. And I hate that touch sensor it's useless, anything touches ur ear it pauses. Overall it's ok product not great"
"I am facing a serious issue with Boat Airpods. Whenever I use to do call there is always a voice break and one side earpods are always making an issue every time. It's hardly 10-11 days since Ive bought it online and I'm really unsatisfied with Baot earpod. Kindly, see to it."
It has very amusing build quality and the size just fits everywhere. I loved the quality and the way it fits in the ear. It wont fall even if ur jogging. I would say bass is 4/5 not much but the sound quality is excellent and it has enough battery that lasts more than a week even if I use it more than 2 hours a day. And the sensor is very smooth.
"Yes, This was much scrutinized before buying. The complete pc of sound, comfort, battery life.I use through out the day during work out, work schedules and late night music.Value for money. go for it. Highly recommended."
"Expected alot, however I've used this for 2-3 months considering all their features. However, you dont get the promised hours of playback. Also,  boat service centre will wobble u around here and there. Its not even been three months i got this, even though in warranty the right ear plays only for 15 mins and shut down. Left one doesn't do justice to 5hrs Esther way. You guys need to promise in a more realistic manner and improve UI."
"Delivery was as usual on time and package was delivered in a good condition.As for the quality of airdopes, i must say i have only used them for a day and i am really liking the experience. They truly are water and sweat proof; the sound quality is AMAZING and i got it on prime day sale so for Rs 2,500/- they are pretty great."
The right dope has stopped working all of a sudden.. Factory reset is also not working. It does not link to the left dope.Need to return it. Too many problems for last 2 days.Right one does not show any light other than Red and on factory reset Green Blink. But does not connect to Left or the phone.How do I return it?
It's not that great. The right ear piece didn't charge all the time. Also as it's touch my calls kept getting dropped even with fiction with hair or a touch. So not really user friendly. The sound was good. I returned it.
Sound quality is good but earbuds battery is not goodAnd earbuds payback time 3 hoursAnd one month latter come earbuds low battery problemI bought this product and one time return this product and then again same problem come battery lowOn 40 % right side earbuds speak battery lowSound quality good but battery problemAfter some time one month letter battery low problem
"I received this product in mid May, I tried to connect it to my laptop (MacBook pro 2019), which it connected but, it kept disconnecting on FaceTime or google meetings (which was my main purpose). It kept interfering with my wifi connection as well on ongoing calls. The left bud's mic was not working properly. I replaced it with the same model thinking that it might be defected piece. But the problem persisted. I wouldn't recommend."
The product is not getting charged and in the last charge one earphone had stopped working. I have tried to reach customer support multiple times but they always ask me.to.visit service center of the city which does not exist and the phone number listed is not picked up ever. I have lost my entire money and the trust in this brand.
I love the quality of this product but there was a issue with the earbud some kind of noise was coming so i ordered a replacement but the item i got maybe thats a used item one earbud metal net is mising and the box was taped with normal tape not with boat branding seal... And thats not acceptable i got then within 2min i placed for refund i will order again ..hope now they will give me the better new item
Very nice air buds by BOAT . super quality  sound and bass .. also the calling quality is  good mic quality is also good.. but it's not a noice cancelable mic but it's clear..  about the battery life i am using it for 5 days it's now 60% charge left .. as a music lover u can go for it.
"Best buy, if you are looking for tws under 3,000 then this boat airpodes are best I got this @1,999/-. But trust me excellent call quality indoor outdoor, sound quality, thumpy bass everything is super awesome. Don't look for noise oppo JBL or any brand if you want to save money and use some real premium build tws with type C port then go for this."
"It is a nice earbud.Demerit-But if you have low pitch then definitely this product is not made for you. As the next person is not going to get your voice over call..Merits -It has finger sensor, that only by touching on the earbuds you can pick up the call and cut the call.Overall it is a good product but recommended only to those who have high pitch..."
There is hardly anything I dislike about the product. Very good product delivered by Boat. Completely worth it. P.s the battery lasts more than what it says in paper
Perfectly fine. Value for money.. Sound quality is very good and noise cancellation too. Touch works fine. Battery backup is also good. Very light weight and easy to handle..
"For the price I was expecting more tuning and balance on the sound quality. It is very much high on the bass. On full volume its too much high on bass, unable enjoy music due to that. Fit is superb, no issues with that. Build quality also is godd. Feels quite premium. Best part is the battery. Once fully charged earbuds lasts around 4.5 to 5 hrs and case back up is also good. Have not charged since last 4 days and still at 50 percent. Go for it if looking for calling and not expecting much on sound quality. Got it for 2.5k in prime sale"
"The boat AirPods 441 Tws is a value for money commodity, have been using the product for past 20 days and there seems to be no noticeable problem as such, whether it may be concerned with sound quality , bass or fittingOne major issue that can I assume considering the current trend is that the battery capacity might reduce with time as it has reduced cognizably since the time I bought it.So all n all, if you are looking for a budget AirPod to cater your demand of different verticals I.e. sports, conversation or entertainment then it may turn out a right choice."
"Sound Quality:Fine.Not loud as expectedNoise cancellation:GoodBass quality:As a basshead i can say it has best bass.Battery: very good.More then expectedConnectivity: Best.no issue in connection.Overall: 3.5 starVerdict: just fine product at INR 2000/- only thing below expectation is loudness otherwise Best in its quality,no issue go for itEdit: Exactly after 3 months of purchase my right earbud isn't working and if it does sometimes either sound breaks up too much or it loses BT connection.Can anyone guide me how to replace/refund because seller gave 1 year warranty ."
"For the price it is giving the quality there is no better product than this. It definitely has the crispness in sound and even the call quality is very good. Music lovers will enjoy this product. It has a decent noise cancellation effect. But for the price, you can't expect more.."
I bought this like 2 months ago and from the last month my right side of airpods was loosing sound the volume is coming very low and ehen i try to talk the other person couldn’t hear my voice. Idk why is this happening so early i expected its good condition atleast for a year but it started getting worse in just a month.Now what Amazon there is no replacement or warranty?
I purchased the product for experimatal purpose to understand how Aman Gupta made this brand so popular. Sadly the product build quality is aweful. Performance as well as the sound quality is extremely poor. Price of the product is high where as its not worth the experience. Better brands are available at a cheaper price with better sound experience. Dissapointed with Boat. Simply wasted my money purchasing it.
Value for Money it's really good product I recommend to purchase it who will really like and love quality audio.
"I've use it for 3 days now. It's great so far. No complain. The sounds great, bass is great. Noise cancellation is very good sometimes too good I can't hear others 😂. And the touch sensor is also good. If you think it's slow than you are hella in a rush. This is my first wireless earbuds and I'm pretty satisfied 😊"
The sound quality is good. However the bass is not as good as it is expressed in the product description. Further I also expected to use it for answering calls. But this is where the product is most disappointing. The mic does not work as expected. Not only that there is a big difference in audio quality that one hears when using with or without mic. Can buy only if one wants to hear music.
Do not buy this product absolute waste of money...I don’t feel like using itMy ear starts hurting after few minutesYou can not talk because of very low quality microphoneCall get disconnected if you touch it by mistake as the button  is designed like thisOverall waste of money highly disappointed
pros: Qyality and looks as displayed in the product description. It's a value for money purchase. Seemles and quality sounds from evrywhere in the house. musics sounds more enjoyable with it's perfect treble and bass balancing.cons: have developed some technical snag with my oneplus 6T. getting disconnected automatically some times. and develops some blurry sounds occassionally.
"I bought this product at the end of month July and at the start it was great a product but now after 4 months the airdopes are not connecting with each other,from the manual guides i saw the factory reset settings and it didn't work .Only one of the pod is working and the other is not connecting.I would like a refund for this bad product which is still under 1 year warranty. I will return the product with original packaging."
Really Love boat product!You will never regret after buying.I have been using it since a month.Earpodes are really light weight and felt really comfortable while using it .Recommeded for bass lovers.Never thought 5mm driver could produce such good quality sound.noice cancellation is pretty good.Sound is not too loud .At maximum volume the sound quality is not affected by the bass.Not really good for calling .But for this price its just best deal.I would really recommend this eardopes.Overall my rating is 4.5/5
It is very good for listening music but bad for calls..It has a touch sensor change buttons and it is very sensitive.. sometimes your hair or anything while using it can change the controls.I thought of returning it back due to very soft touch but Amazon didn’t had any option.So forced to use it now.. but music is at best.
"The sound and call quality was awesome. There is a little bit of lagging in games. I am very much impressed with the build quality.I would recommend to purchase this product rather than noise shots neo.Your 2499 investment will not be vain.Again, best for music lover and calling facility."
Fits well in the ear sound quality and bass is also good a useful product if you want to enjoy music bluetooth connectivity is quick and simple operating function colour changing led lights make it stylish
Pros:Good Sound quality.Boosted bass.huge battery backup.Decent passive noise cancellation.Inats wake and pair technology( no issues connecting the device)Cons:No premium finish.(feels like some cheap Chinese product)No volume control.Made in China.An average product for a decent price but it's the best in 2.5k segment!
Noise cancellation zero. You will all other noises other than person if you and other person using it outside thick walls of your house.Not compatible with all devicesWon't work on some device for video calling it will lagOn regular call your voice will Break where other end person ends up complaining casnot hear us.Writing this after using it for one and half year .
The earphones perform pretty good. But if you drop it accidently from even 2ft it starts having connectivity issues. I dropped mine accidently from my bed to the floor. Since then the right earpod has been sporadically losing connection and getting it back. Very annoying.
"The sound quality is very good. However, the microphone could be better. That is because it doesn't have the active noise cancellation, due to which a lot of stray noise goes in while using the mic. Otherwise, this is a very decent piece of tech at this price."
"My Airdopes were great for a month. Today, suddenly, the volume became so low 😣 that I couldn't hear anything properly. I tried using it on other phones,it's the same. I also tried using my brother's airdopes on my phone to see if it's a problem with my phone or my Airdopes and it works fine. So clearly my Airdopes are the problem. Please fix it!!"
These airdopes are best in the segment..I use them for workout and for my online classes and they are just mind-blowing..If you are searching for ear buds under this price range so they are the best choice. This review is on the basis of my 2 months use and they are obviously better than oppo buds..the bass is amazing...just go for it👍
"Very nice product, bass quality is very good, easy to use, proper fit in the ears, overall look is very nice."
"Constant hissing sound from left earbud, batch is defective applied for return. Should have tested the product before releasing. Poor testing of product causes unnecessary customer harassment."
"Just can't believe what happened, I initially received a unit which was defective and had a constant low frequency static noise emanating out of the left earpod. So, I ordered for a replacement, Got the product today and to my utter disbelief, the replacement unit also has the same issue. I'm so so disappointed with this buy. I hope someone from BOAT takes notice of this and checks if this is a common occurrence in most of their units."
"Sound quality is good. The only drawback is battery backup. You can only use it upto 3.5-4 hours. If you're binge watching a series, you'll get fed up with the drainage of battery. After that you need to put in the box for at least an hour which is quite irksome. After all, its a good buy. Boat 441 Pro enters. Now *crying in the corner* exchange kardo bhai 😒"
"I am not using this for calling purpose. It fits in ear very comfortably. Durable material. It fell down lots of times from my hand but never broke. And battery is amazing. It lasts for 3-4 days for me. If I am using it to watch movies , it lasts like 1 or 1 and half days."
"So before this I has used the Bolt truebass, compared to that I can the sound quality is much much better with good bass and clarity, haven't tested call quality yet, overall build quality is also good, only thing is it's a bit difficult while removing it from the case"
I ordered the sporty blue color one first time. As soon as I connected I noticed that there is a continuous noise playing in the left earpiece but no problem with the right one. I thought I had received a defective one so requested the replacement and received a new sporty blue color one again. But again the same issue continuous noise in the background from the left earpiece. I don't know for sure why the problem is happening with the blue ones. I hope the problem won't arise with the Black color ones.But the sound quality is just amazing. The only problem I faced is the noise.
Looks and lighting is cool.Sound quality is superb.Yes noise cancellation works very well..Battery life is very good.All over.. Again its great exp with boqt product.. ❤️
"Comfortably fit in my ear with small size of buds, well fitted in ear. Sound quality is good depnds on mp3 quality. I listen dolby atmos songs with this product, sound ouput is very well. Charge ver early, look is good, noise cancellation is good, some time when i go little away from phone connectivity is lost and pair immediately after a seconds."
I don't find a reason to return it. In love with boAt.
"The product looks nice but is tough to use. if it connects to a phone, then it does not leave it and becomes like a leech, when you disconnect, you need to switch off the system to get the control back to the system. it is very unpredictable - you don't know when it will connect to the phone or PC, it just might not. and as it is bought from Amazon, there is no way to get any support . Real sad I could not return it in time. AVOID"
"First, it keeps falling off the ears every 2 minutes. Second, sound quality is really poor. I have to increase the volume of my phone to almost full to hear properly from these Aurdopes whereas I can easily hear from other regular earphones evenwhen my phones volume is around lowest. Overall, I wasted my money. My regular wired earphones are a thousand times better than this."
"I wasn’t expecting a great music quality in these earphones and it turned out to be the same, the quality is just ok. But for phone calls, my expectations were high but it seems the voice is not so clear on the other end. There is an echo most of the times and it’s not so comfortable to wear for long time. I feel irritated after 15-20 mins usage, the time may change from person to person."
"The sound quality is good ,,its more towards the lows and mids and high are good enough ,,perfect of bass lovers ."
"Awesome build quality, perfect sound ,can get prettt high on full voulme i dont go above 30% its more than enough sound for ne,lovebthe functionality of auto connect perfect touch sensors just the left ear pod sometimes comes off the ear so gotta use with a bit of care loving it!"
"I used this earphones, it provides extra Base which doesn't need and also there is no control on base that's why can not use this for more than 20 minutes.If listen songs for more than 20 minutes, on ear irritation starts."
"It is a nice product and the ease of use and the sound is good in this price range. The only problem I have is that when I use it for talking with others, I have to speak very loudly or they cannot hear me. So it is good mostly for listening."
"Battery life is 3hr but case battery is goodGood for calling,Battery is highly drained during using of Google meet and zoom"
"Earphone is good, sound quality is good but bass quality is ok. Its take 2 to 3 days for use to with this earpod with its touch screen otherwise backup is very good. Overall experience is nice with this earpods. Can go for this earpods easily."
"The quality is great! Very light and fit to the ears. Bass is great! Played pubg and it's working just fine without any lag. Pretty much worth the price. Sound is perfect and there's no issue in calling, clear sound! All over it's perfect! 5/5"
I am a avid user of BOAT and this product has been a sheer disappointment. Half of the times one earphone doesnt work. Also when i am attending calls suddenly they stop working and require a reset without any warning. You might miss half of your meeting conversations as you will think nobody is speaking maybe
"number one goin with the comfort,it hurts my ears a lot dispite of using both the regular and the small sized earbudsgoin with the sound quality there is a bit of lag while using it for watching videosand the last,not recommended for gaming at all,there is lag on every real time thing u do on the game"
Really good product with good bass and good touch controls. Sometimes left airdope unpairs. For this you have to keep both airdopes back in the charging box and simultaneously press both off them until blue light blinks rapidly. This sets the airdopes back to factory setting. Now pair it again to your bluetooth device and plugin to nirvana!
"Just removed packing and opened the charging box, they blink towards me...a bluish blinking.... Auto pairing also good..good audio effects , bass and sound quality. Boat always good.."
"Bass is too good , build up is solid and premium looking in this price range but noise cancellation is poor and no volume control slight cons , sometimes it's get disconnected still not that bad sound clarity is awesome it looks premium in given price .. overall one can go for it .. this product is worthy if purchased within 2000 .. go for itPros1. Premium looking2. Excellent bass3. Capacitive touch4. Nicely fit into ears5. Good sound qualityCons :1. No noise cancellation2. No volume control"
"The sound quality is completely good and clean , but the fact is after 1-2 hrs your ear start paining...A good factor i found is that when someone call me i used one earphone . So that is the advantage...Go for it... and tried it..."
"It worked well for 6 months. Although the sound quality is a bit of a compromise. Fitment is OK but you are never certain. However the biggest issue is reliability. I had the first problem about 2 months ago when only one the earbuds would work at a time. Tried everything written in the brochure, and shown on videos...even factory reset. Tired of it all I have now applied for warranty. Will update on the status soon."
"This earphone is better then airpods, it does not fall from our ears and if you hear 8d music your experience will be in next levelBass quality is very good and overall the earphone is perfect. Charging time is very less and work more then 30 hours"
Not comfort to use in ear continuouslyGood at this price range...But it causes pain in the pinna(ear) after one hour of usage...I changed to the soft fins and ear buds supplied along with the eardopes...but still it causes pain after an hour...Otherwise good...Battery backup I have to check in the upcoming days and write a review
"The product is amazing. Loved it. I'm facing just 1 problem and that is left earairdop after connecting it to mobile, it makes some kind of noise and it stays there even during music and without music. Buy it but check it use it before returnable period incase u want to replace it. If you have One Plus then don't buy this bcz it only gives access to music and not for calling. U won't hear or answer calls."
"This product is super good , sounds quality, base what ever  is awesome but  got disconnected like every 3/4 minutes especially while making a phone call / vdeocall  i fell uncomfortable for that reason.  No problem  while playing music  its  super cool"
Overall it is a value for money product given the price tag of Rs. 2499.Connectivity is very good. Instantly connects with my OnePlus Nord on opening the case.The shark fins fit nicely in the ear. The design of the buds is very elegant. The case is also very compact and neat looking. Battery life is extremely good.The sound output is the only area which needs improvement. It is not very high even at full volume.
The audio quality of the product seems good. The issue I faced is the battery life. The product was defective. I only noticed it after a month. The left earphone only had a battery backup of around 40 minutes. The nearby service station around my area is 30 Km away. Now for a Rs.2000 product I can't afford to spend money on traveling expenses and waste my day. They also refused door to door service even after advertising such on their site page.
Am reviewing after using 3 months.The sound is not proper after using 2.5 months on right ear bud. It started heating up.Now even the left ear bud start to heat up after listening 5-10 minutes.So think before buying. The sound quality was good intial day but after using for 3 months both the buds were almost gone. Its of no use. Both buds heating up day by day.The one who gave positive comments were those commented when they using intial days. Even i felt the same initial days but now its horrible.
The earbuds worked great with mobile phone but lost connectivity of sound when paired with laptop multiple times during conference calls. They seemed to work with one to one conference calls but not with many speakers in a conference. But on the mobile they are awesome1. Earfit is good2. Sound and Bass is great3. Reception coverage area is good upto 10 mtrs4. The mic is weak and it takes the person to speak loud when attending the call
Very painful to earsThe design seems to be good but in reality its very painful to earsCould not hear properly on callsVery heavy sound lag while playing gamesTouch will stop respoding after few daysMost importantly they are not refunding the money evebln after u can only get a replacement so do not buy this

 These boat airdopes are really dope ;) okay jokes aside but ssly I'm in love w these does since I saw them first time. They're cool and stylish  also they've good bass quality  and excellent sound quality.  Was unbelievable that I got them at such a good price and was worth it!! If you're  looking for something stylish  and excellent sound quality then you must go for Boat Airdopes  441!! And the rest you'll get to know when you'll buy them;)!!"
"The product is very convenient and easy to use. The sound quality for listening to music is great. However the noise cancellation is not up to par. During phone conversation, there is quite a bit of disturbance. Overall build and battery performance is good"
"After sales service is very pathetic from BOAT, please don't buy any product from Boat. I received a faulty product which was not charging with the given Charger and I had to return the same. After one month, I got a replacement with a different colour and surprisingly they have NOT given me back Charging cable, Additional Air Muffs and Warranty card. No one picks calls at their call center and my emails are also not responded to. They don't have service centers also, where I can go and raise complaints. I am very dissatisfied with overall experience with BOAT."
"The build quality feels premium and looks very stylish, capactive touch controls on the buds are very smooth with quick response, cool flashy led lights on buds and the sound quality is great."
"It's very bad for calling, the receiver is not able to hear me at all. And when I am switching to phone's mic the other person can hear me properly, so there is some issue in this mic. Now I want to return it but I am not getting the option for returning. I'll have to replace it with other set of the same product. Why ? Why can't I return it if I don't have trust in this product anymore ?"
"Product was very useful...it is best for watching movies and songs..but there is some problems during a call..the conversation we are having is breaking up..while we are talking to a person ,we can hear clearly...but the person on the other side cant hear the complete sentence...same problem is faced during voice messages...for me..am using this earbuds only for watching movies and for songs ,so there is no problem for me😉"
"The Airdopes 441 ar really great. They give a good fit and they don't fall even if you jump. The sound quality and it's features are also good. Recieved it in just one day after ordering. The battery backup is also good. But, the bass quality is not good. Then also, Thank You boAt."
"I used Earpiece and found that they are making pain in ear within 15-20 Minutes. They makes pressure on a side of Ear and causes Pain. It has power backup of 5 hours but due to Faulty Design of Earpiece you cannot use them beyond Half Hour. Further, Either of the Earpiece gets Off intermittenly. Imagine listing a Song / waching Movie while 1 of your Left / Right Earpiece getting On-Off at their own. Totally waste of Money."
I would really not want to waste my time in giving them feedback too but still its only for the sake of other customers who shouldn't go Cheated for the reason why I'm making this point do not go with any Amazon products its all cheap and low quality.. they are looting customers by selling third grade products
"Purchased it on first day of launch at 2.5k.Its very good TWS in its price range as it offers a beast battery life.Its design and build is normal & not that premium but it works flawlessly whether we talk about its sound, its connectivity and its grip on ears. It didn't feel that heavy on ears but the case is definitely a bit heavy because it has 2600 mAh battery which is really huge. Connecting it is very easy and set is also hassle free, just go through the manual once and one will understand all its settings. It has metal hosing which is definitely a very good thing to mention. It has type C charging which is very good in its segment. Overall its a very good product with very good specs. One thing worth mentioning that its made in China product."

 This earpods provides good sound quality. But they cannot actually be inside ears when you are wearing a mask and will fall down.I gave it four stars because sometimes I'm facing trouble connecting to my mobileEdit after six months: it stopped connecting to my mobile and I'm gonna claim my warranty"
this is a good budget earbuds with great sound.Compared to headphones volume is bit low even in max volume option.I was personally recommended by a friend to buy this and I dont regret it at all.Only thing is that on prolonged usage the earbuds feel a bit uncomfortable .good while running and exercisingGO FOR IT!
Overall i am very satisfied with my purchase. I purchased it in freedom sale for ₹1999. It has a good bass.. long range .. and a good bttry life !! What else i expect in this range? 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Like it because i can take it in my pocket anywhere. Sound quality is good. But not give proper sound in low volume. Noise cancelation and bass quality as per average. Can give 4 star for value for money.
"The headphones look really good and appealing, when connected with mobile music playback is pretty decent but call quality is bad no noice cancellation & when connected to a Mac Book there is some weird unnecessary noice especially in the left ear, not good for taking calls, to attend meetings, or video conference. There are echo issue as well.I went through many review on Amazon, many users are facing this issue, I don't see there is any resolution that the users have received."
"sound quality is good but bass is very goodgo for it ❤️recommendedand comfortable, light weight, perfect fitting you can do gym, running and other outdoor activities while wearingEven you can sleep with it very light weight go for it ❤️❤️i am happy with that productsmall and portable and  battery life really awesome 3-4 battery life"
uncomfortable after few minutes as your ears will start hurting not because of sound but the material kind of hurts your ear for wearing it for too long. Bass is not that good it’s average unlike there wired headphones which are good but cheaper.
Very uncmfrtable to wear..need to remove d sharkfin fr cmfort..also u nd to remve it carefuly else d button gets clickd as it is touch sensitive..u cnt hear anythng outside as it is like a vaccum
this product is very nice tthanks for selling Amazon But I used this produt after 5to6 month thish product problem face me not a charging propali air buds only over all product is very impresev...
"After 6 months of usage, I'm really disappointed with this. It has gone bad twice during this time. I had to go to a service centre really far away (since they don't have pickup in Banglore) to get it replaced, only for the replacement to stop working after 2 weeks. I'm done with boat products now. At this price range, you should make better stuff."
The music sounds really good an deep. Movies sound like we are sitting in a theatre. Truly immersive experience. The default ear fins were uncomfortable. Changed it with the smaller ones that cam with the Airdopes. Noise isolation is also very good. Total value for money.
Perfect purchase.....excellent sound quality...bass perfect...noice reduction good......very good product under that price category......really enjoying it.......thanks to boAt...and Amazon....
Review after ten days use.Very good airdopes from boat.genuine product with best sound quality.bass is superb.totally a awesome for a this price.
Its good as per price. However other high valued items from other manufacturers but their price is very high.So nice product in this price range.
"After using 5 months, it started showing problems. Sometimes, the sound is not proper, and sometimes left side of the earbud doesn't connect to the device. It really pathetic that after paying a good amount of 2.5k, I am getting this cheap product.I am never buying any product from this company again."
"A) Won't workout for telephonic conversation, as they said no noise cancellation...B) Slippery.C) After using 37 days right side airdope touch control not working.Better go for good one..."
customer service is very bad.....after few days the balance of left and right airdopes changed...i complained about it and went to the customer service. at first they were not ready to rely with my problem and then they refused by saying that it may be my phone's problem and should use it with another phone...I mean seriously!!! a big applause !! I will never buy a boat product and will not recommend this company to others.!!
Iam posting my review after almost 1 and a half year usage. You wont get the best smooth sound and the best bass in mi airdopes or any other brand at this price. Sound is smooth n bass is awsome. I bought this and checked and then i went to a store to check mi airdopes and zebronics airdopes. Boat airdopes are far better than those both company at this price.
"I had bought the product 3 weeks back. The product was good for the price until the right pod stopped charging. The left pod works fine alone. I have not used the pod extensively either. As the Return window is closed, I need to go by the very conventional method of calling their customer care to find a resolution. If I do not get this sorted soon through the warranty period, then no more ""boAt"" products for me anymore."
There is only problem that there is stir voice when you are not listening and in a repetitive way on left side sometimes . Otherwise I bought this two times and this is a perfect product if i compared with apple quality. You are getting the same quality in 2.5k
It is totally waste of money.Sound quality is very Pathetic. Even 500rs Hands free have good sound quality. it doesn't fit properly in ear.bass quality is also bad.i had  boat rockerz 210.it was an amazing product.but this time i am very much disappoint.
"I have bought it for 2499 in indipendenxe day sale on aug .I returned the device to amazon after 5 days of use because left side stopped working then amazon send me a new one , since then 2.5 months has been passed n device is working smooth. I mark a hiss sound in a deep silent atmosphere in left bud , it is neglegiable , i feel its not static sound perhaps its a type of echo sound n can't be called as device problem . Battery of both buds are awesome n same is the case of the battery case provided with the buds . Blinking lights give the buds a premium loook. Love u boat n its my 3rd personal boat product n perhaps the 50th boat audio product i hav bought ."
Sound quality is average but there is issue with mic. It works fine for few days of couple of week but after that people will not be able to understand what you're saying over the phone. Then you'll have to disconnect this device and  phone so that people can understand.It happens with all the boat earphone whether it is wired or wireless.
It's being 15days of my use and I am getting some noisy interruption while listening to any songs or watching any videos.. just like when a bursting speaker sounds like. Not a good one when it comes to sound quality... Bass is fine at this range. Not a good product at this range to purchase
"While talking microphone is not good, touch sometimes works sometimes you have to press hard not sensitive like other eardops think before you buy.while driving is useless as the opposite person can't hear you soo much disturbance."
"The product is overall good. Good power backup, sound quality and bass. But while in call, the person on the otherside has issues in hearing . Also while sending voice messages you'll have to keep your phone nearer. And sometimes I get irrated due to its touch sensor . So u can't watch the videos while laying down . Once you turn one side the video gets paused and its really irritating . But the fit is good , I think for this price its a good wireless earphone."
Tiny colour full and comfortable. Voice clarity was also good. Case is very handy.Battery backup is not as specified. Left works for 30 minutes and right for 2 hours.
"Going by the reviews I purchased this airdopes hoping it's a good product. For the first 2 weeks, it was great. After that things went downhill. One full charge gives you only 1 hour of usage. It's of no use now. Don't buy if you think about the long term"
"Really comfortable to use. No need to change any settings, connecting fast. Cool to listen music. You can use a case as charging for pods and also as power bank for mobiles"
"I've gotten these for Rs. 2500, the black version, and it so far does seem to be worth the money. One thing I have to note is that the ear hooks for the earbuds I've received are different from the pictures on the website. They're softer and more delicate, but they still work well and are comfortable. The noise isolation is not as good as the Airdopes 451, but good enough. Bass is better than I expected, and for me, the audio quality stays the same even after increasing the volume."
Comparatively with other products with the same price are good to use.Firstly it took one eternity to connect with my handphone. After connecting to phone also am unable to hear songs or voice over both airdopes.Again it took long time after made many research only I can able to connect the airdopes and heard sounds from both device.Very horrible experience for me with this product.
Ear pain after use for 2 days workout for less than one hour. It is because the ear hook is not perfect. And maybe my ear canal is small so I have to press the earpods deep into my ears to hook the earhook.
"the battery in the charging case will most likely be worn out by 4 months of usage. Then you'll have to charge the case everytime you charge the earbuds. So yeah, charging issues, battery not reliable."
Good airpods but uncomfortable fit and its highly sensitive touch panel is equally irritating. And a krr noise comes everytime in left earbud.
Very solid noice cancellationPerfect fit for your earNo way it's fall down from your earIssue is sound disconnect for second now and then while you jog or walk.Break your mood while listening songsSo I have to return this
The sound and bass quality is too good. Also the battery backup is okay. Well it's worth the money.
Sound quality is pretty decent while considering budget I was little bit disappointed with the bass qualityI have been using boat produts since 2 years I have boat spinX Boat Soundbar boat rockers 255 pro all those where we're good at base but  it's little bit low when compared to them and more over while comming to gamming lag it can be rectified with some settings in developer options and now there is no sound lag while playing game like pubg
"The quality is really not good. Wondering how people can give 5 stars. There is no volume control. Even at max volume with my Redmi note 8 pro, the sound is not sufficient. also less beats and very less bass. Not worth even at 999/-"
this is worst earpodes and I fooled by its brand.it has a big lag while talking on phone and tonnes of difficulties while connecting. sometime 1 works n smtime others. and the capacitive touch is not functioning well
Look wise good quality also good specialy red &black shed but connectivity is bad when you open your buds he take time to connect with your device and when I use to cll some one they don't recognise my voice and when u put your buds in box but your device show buds is connectedIt's up to you when you spend your valuable money then you have to choose good one
A great pair of airdopes. It was the first time I was buying a boAt product. And their quality is great.It has all the functions that an apple air pods pro has. It can be paired with apple and android. Best buds you can ever find!
After more than 15 days of usage can say that one of the best sub 2000 ₹ tws earbuds..sound quality is good.. battery backup i usually get is 4-5 hours and the case charges buds 3-4 times..its decent enough..bass is on a tad bit heavier side but good..nothing to worry about..looks awesome..fit is as u will want..indoor call quality is ok but outdoors will make the person on call with you wondering what are u sayin..rated ipx7 and have tested it in heavy rain..overall will recommend to music lovers 👍🏻
"Overall not worth 2499 , doesn’t fit well in ear. Little heavy . Actual price 6999 and the offer 64% is just to fool customers. It is worth much less than that around 1200 I would say ."
"Problems will start after six months of buying boat products and warranty is just a word, you don't get any support from Boat or Amazon and you can see all boat service center review in google. My personal opinion is don't waste your mony on Boat Products, boat products are chep in price and quality both. Boat products will only feel good quality from outside. Don't be fool guys."
"Pros: Good sound quality, noise cancellation and bass. Instant pairing with mobile.Cons: Fitting to external ear and pinna is poor and it falls off frequently or feels uneasy to ear because of poor ergonomics."
I'm writing review after a very long.. I have been using them since a very long and they are the best for all type of ear...Actually I have a problem that I rarely any earphone settle onto my ear... But this product and the quality in this price range is supper...😊
"The product is not to the expected quality. The bluetooth disconnect without any indication. To connect again, charging box required. Every time it discount, needed to place in the charging box.Ear pain will start within half an hour of wearing.Will not suit for all people.Sound quality is better.Overall product is not worth for the money."
"This product works great for the price range given. It's been almost weeks since I used it. They have good enough sound quality and Bluetooth coverage is not wide enough but it is great for using the airpods without the phone or device within the area of the room the device is in. The design is also good enough for the price range. It connects to device is easier. If anyone is looking for affordable airpods, I would suggest them these."
The product is good for hearing music.  The sound quality is superb.  The blue tooth connectivity with Laptop for meetings is pathetic.  Lot of disturbance and drag during meetings. The meetings has to be dropped and logged in again to gain good output.The mic in the device needs improvement as one have shout out loud for the opponent in phone line to hear.Pros: Good for musicCons: Not a choice for speaking / calls
"The buds won't place properly on the charging pin with smaller fin attachment on. It needs to adjust at the correct level with the pin to set properly. Overall great value for money product, super punchy bass and vocals, rapid fast pairing and battery backup is superior at this price range. Highly recommended."
"After 5 months of use, I must say that I am fully satisfied with this purchase of mine. These earbuds have excellent sound and build quality though its case could have been much better. And how their ear-fitting is on such level that even if I start dancing and shake your head carelessly, they won't even budge a bit. I use them on 70% volume because listening to it on 100% volume will make me deaf. I just love them."
"This when used with Microsoft teams on laptop gives gibberish voice, also microphone doesn't work with it.  I took this specifically for office purpose but now it has no use to me. Really bad product"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am writing this review on 29/Jul/2020 and I got this product exactly 1 month ago. Boat airdopes 441 sounded very promising but it has disappointed me a lot,1) the case cover was loose since beginning as you can see in the video it closes just with a tilt.2) The earphones sometimes disconnects while I run for 2-3 seconds.3) It does not have a proper noise cancellation Coz when I speak with someone with the fan on it creates a disturbance.4) Most importantly the earphones are not charging while I put them in the case and they are still connected to my phone even when the case lid is closed. Now I'm trying to claim for warranty."
"Bass is amazing. When volume is at 100% then bass is one of the best quality for this price. Sound quality is also amazing but the noise cancellation can do with some work.but for this price point, the quality is awesome. For people who want a high quality budget earphones, this product is a no brainer"
"You can purchase this device if you want good battery life.But if you need best sound quality, best voice call, everything best except battery.. than i recommend you go for other companies airbuds because there is so many airbuds right now in the market in this price segment..I purchased this only because many times i am not able to charge my device due to heavy busy schedule."
"high quality sound also good noise cancellation, superb bass, very handy and nice package.The only issue I have faced is of ear adjustment some times when not properly set may cause little pain in your ear."
"Damaged product received ,left ear pod not able to hear any audio.Only if charged full for 5-10 min can hear and battery drains out immediately.I got it as a gift to my wife, and gave the box place to her after 15 days of delivery. And found problem with left pod. Now i cant ask.for replacement also.Currently I am only using right side pod as a punishment .Request for support and replacement."
Discomfort when you use it for a long time. Sound and everything is good. It's just that if there is discomfort while you use it. The overall experience gets affected. I would suggest you to go for OnePlus buds instead of this.
° Buds backup max to max (in zoom call)=2hr.° Backup with case = 3 days max.° Voice volume is too low in calling° Mic can easily win the world's worst mic title.- Sound quality is gud- base is gud- fitting is normal nothing special.
"Product is having heavy bass, so it’s little bit difficult to use for hearing music and watching movies. The sound out put is much low compared to the bass is produce. Since it’s an ear bud extreme bass makes it uncomfortable sometimes. Battery performance is worthy. Calling ability is also quite good. Cannot be recommended for gaming. Those who like heavy bass do purchase, others please stay away ..."
This airdope is exceptional. Highly recommended if the price lies in between 1.8k - 2.0k. The sound clarity is excellent and noise cancellation works pretty well.Only con is that one cannot adjust volume by the capacitive touch in the earpiece. Rest all looks good. Using for more than 4 months now... Didn't see any issue.
"The sound qulaity is ok , prefer only to use it for watching movies only. Long time use is not recommended as the ear starts hurting.Use for responding to calls not advisable as lot of surround sound also get transmitted and the person at the other end gets to hear a lot of noise.Bluetooth is good, gets synced as soon as you open the box"
Nice product especially given the price. Sometimes issue with sticking with the ear Comes out at times when used while exercising. Noise cancellation not that great but for the price it is worth it.
"Very nice buds and offered at very cheap price during sale. Indeed very good sound quality, perfect bass and looks. Very helpful for the people who love music and want to close their ears from routine kich kich of surroundings ☺"
"I basically liked the sound quality, then the color that blinks, and have been using boat headset long time before. I love the package and the quality."
Like sound quality and wirefree  and dislike : cannot use for long hours ear starts paining after hour of use and not suitable  if u want Bluetooth to connect two device at the same time for stereo mode  . The ear buds can fall off from ears and chances of misplaced-are high.Wanted to return the product however my return deadline is crossed
"You can not take calls using Teams, Slack, Google meet or Zoom. It crashes whenever I try to start a call with air dopes connected go laptop. You can only listen to music."
"Just amazing man. The bass is excellent at this price range. I can say it has a very good bass then noise shots groove. I use both , but I felt boat 441 has better bass than noise. Go for this."
"Just placed an order for this item this morning. Got delivered within a couple of hours, because that's what the offer said. But when I opened it this doesn't turn on, forget getting connected to my phone. Only the blue LED on the earbuds box/holder shows on but nothing apart from that. I need it to be replaced ASAP or a refund. This the 1st time that I've been delivered a faulty product by AMAZON. I ain't happy."
"This product is for bass heads. May be a bit overdone on the bass, but I like it that way. Very good quality music. However, not very comfortable on the ear for longer usage. Maybe I used the larger rubber padding, now changed it to smaller one. Everything is good for the price except the rubber used, it's very low quality and can be seen without even touching it. Otherwise I loved the product. That 1 star deduction is for the rubber quality."
"Connectivity issue while using only single piece. While having a walk, it stayed fit for half an hour but then due to sweating, it eventually came out of ear quite a times. Battery life is good. Now I think, would have been better if had purchased OnePlus bullets wireless Z or some similar products. They come at same price."
Review after 10 days of usageSound quality - 4/5Battery backup- 5/5Build quality - 5/5Potability - 5/5And biggest thing because of which i bought it is a type c port.Great tws earphones go for it
"I got the damaged product, my left earbud is not working properly because that was damaged from the begining another customer return the product then they gave me that damaged product..If you are selling the product then u will have to check first it's working or not."
Glad to find a emergency power bank functionality in it.Sound is good for the price.No Active Noise Cancellation though.Mic is a total trash. Can't use them for calls at all.It is not good for long term usage. After 5 months the problems started. Sometimes either or both of the buds won't charge being inside the case. You may find it is still connected to your device despite being inside the case. Very annoying till the 9th month. Had to replace them. Connectivity issues are also there. No software updates.

 Bought it for doing online classes. Now I'm left with just one working earpiece. Battery life is 3+ hours so I can manage to do just one class but can't continue further for watching current affairs videos, etc. Sound quality is good (3.7 stars) what but do I do with just one piece working?"
"One side of the ear bud  Never gets fully charged and gets drained very very Quickly by the time I realised the mandatory window for return of the product was over...Now I am stuck with a product which is of no use to me, they have given a faulty product...I have got replacement and now even this is not working !What’s the soliton ?? I thought I am not able to place it right in charger container but that’s not true, the left side is working fine.."
Really sad to give bad review about the Product of boat airdopes..Product is damaged while opening the  airdopes right side piece...Left side is working fine...Bluetooth connection is prefect...But only left side ear piece is working fine..Right side piece because of damage not working..no light indication and can't able to reset the right side airdopes also...no response from right side one..I hope amazon will do the needful in this product damage..Replacement is required on the same product...
"Nice ear fit, and sound quality.Not ideal for calling while moving (sound of air overpowers your voice) yet at still place call quality is good.Can be used as monopod.Fast connectivity and responsive touch.Overall a good buy in the budget."
"Good product in terms of connectivity and strong fitting in ear. The charging case battery lasts almost 10 days or more. However, on call, the earbuds do not last more than 2.5 hours. Thus the claim of 4 hours on advertising is not true in my case. Base is not much pronounced as driver size is 6 mm.Else rest of the things are ok"
There is a major issue with charging. Both sides don't charge at the same time when plugged either of them will not charge when kept together for charging. Battery gets low too soon. Charging is a big trouble with these.
I will recommend not to purchase this product. I experienced very poor service within guarantee period. Nobody will respond you. I have sent my product for replacing/repairing for last 6 months. neither i am receiving my product nor money back. Very unprofessional Customer Dealings by the Customer Care Executives.
"The bass quality is brilliant, cancels noice, good for gaming too, easy talking and reasonable battery life. It's what one should expect and I bought it at a discount rate of Rs.2000/-."
"Works Extremely well with Touch sensors and Connectivity.Right Over Left works slightly better but it isn't something like a Fault to be afraid of.Base Quality and Clarity 10 out of 10.It's that one Product under 3000 which would never be a loss to buy🎶Texture, Charging Hours and CaseTexture is Matt Finish so Gives Completely a Royal look, One Time Full charge can last upto 1 month in Case.Overall 4.8 out of 5 Stars"
Nice product with a good battery life. Also a great customer service. Emails and complaints are replied to within a dayHad some issue with one earphone. Was replaced without any hassles and at no extra cost. No need to visit the service center for replacement

 Writing review after using it for almost 15 days. Bluetooth connectivity is ok. Sound quality is not that much good. It pains little bit when used continuesly for 1 hr. Bass is too high. Notice cancellation is not that much good."
The unit right ear is now conking off after 4 months and the battery  longevity has detroriated to 15 min.Good looking product but I would say Chinese life.
"Its one of the amazing products which has been recently launched my Boat. Kudos to you guys to deliver such an amazing product at this price range. The bass, sound quality and the noise cancellation works amazing. Overall I am really happy with it. You open its charging box and VOILA it just takes us to the next level of entertainment of music."
I purchased this product on 09.11.2021. This product was sold with one year warranty. One of the ear pod (left) is not working. Pls inform how to repair/replace the damaged ear pod which is in warranty. Please address our concern urgently.
"It's speaker is very good , but it's Mike is not as good as it's speaker. Whenever u talk on phone it looks like you are speaking from 100 meters yard far from the Mike when u r using this. Plz make its mike good thn Aftr that it become unmatchable."

 Delivery was very fast. Sound quality is good. But the led of the right bud is not blinking."
Sound quality is good. bAss is also very good. Battery life is also very good and type - C adds more value. The only thing I don't like is it's a little on tougher side to wear for me maybe because I am headphone user and it's my first time in ear earpiece. Overall it's good.
"It worked fine for the first few weeks but after that the right bud dies not sync with the left bud. I don't what the problem is, I tried resetting the device but then too the device doesn't work sometimes. Think before you buy this is just a luxury item that you can brag in front of everyone and that's all you can do. Now I am using a wired 5yr old earphones from Nokia and that is better!!"
Super earphones. Very small and light weight. Not comfortable for a longer time but they are good one of you are looking for a budget earphones.
"Don't buy any products at offer time in Amazon. Delivered low quality or refurbished products. I realized it this time.Initially i got nonfunctional one, then i returned and got replacement. This one is working but very poor quality of sound.I am very disappointed."
"I had ordered these earphones sometime back and immediately had to return them because of an issue. I had initially ordered for a replacement but had to return it as well because of the same issue. The issue I faced was that one of the earbuds left/right made a crackling sound when streaming content. This became particularly very annoying while watching movies as the crackling sound would be very prominent there.Overall, it was a very disappointing experience."
"I used the product for a day and its great. But what concerns me is the charging case. Its not of great quality. I tried to reach to Boat customer care to understand whether we can purchase an extra charging case but no one received the call.After sales services looks horrible. Hope to hear back from them at least over email. I would have given 4 stars, but reduced because of my experience to reach the service team."
"Its a bit glitchy at times. Sound quality is okaish.The touch sensitivity makes it difficult to use, unintentional touches makes it stop. Microphone quality is good with phone calls, but doesn't function very well with zoom on mac.Update after 2 years:Today it took a trip through washing machine and a full wash cycle for 1 hour, interestingly still works!!!"
"Excellent fit, sound quality and battery life. The mic picks up a lot of background noise and can't be used unless in a very quiet room, which defeats the purpose of working from home/open office."
"This is very nice bluetooth and voice clearity is good. But there is no noice cancellation. Infact if you are in a room, blutooth's microphone catch sound which is outside of your room. And sometimes otherside person is not able to hear what you are saying, but they can able to hear the noice sound"
"I have been using it for one year. Overall I can say this is a good product. Sound quality, Noise Cancellation and Bass quality is very good.But at the same time, most disappointable thing is, its battery backup. If you use it continuously, EarBuds gone discharge very faster within one hour.It has an another defect. The EarBuds never shows 100% changed. When you connect, it will show 90% charged."
"The product is really good and easy to use.For sportspersons like me this is the best product which you get in this price.The battery backup is amazing . You do a full charge and forget ,as it's going to last for a very very long time."
I have not comfortable this product ....please return my profuct .and return my money .
"What a great purchase....no need to see reviews...Close ur eyes and go for it....Perfect connectivity, great audio quality with extremely punchy deep bass and very premium earbuds and case....best fitting....."
I have been trying to use this product for last 2 months. The voice drops frequently in the headphone. The microphone is of poor quality and hence can not be used for any calls. There is no refund either.I bought Cross beats headphone 2 years back and it works perfectly even now.
i am ordering  441 boat  company airpodes10 days proper working thanfew days lattervoice less automatically muteit is not working properly Bluetooth connctivity is good but no voice audio vidio calls song etcmute voice less aurpod customer care service is not Good i am  call 3 to 5 time but no buddy response  not attending my call customer toll free number is not working.boat service center not helping  me
"Very good product for music listeners it has a good quality of bass and noise cancellation with ultra strong grip of holding it comes with a pair of small grip,a pair of large grip,2pairs of earbuds and a charging cable it is a good product to buy in this range and it's look is also good it come's with it's doc where you can put your airdopes and it get charged in the doc itself ."
"At first, reading a few negative reviews about the product being defective or malfunctioning got me a second thought about this, but trusting on the brand I thought to take a chance and tbh, I just love this dopepods."
I never write reviews but i am so disappointed with this product that i have to write it.Just 2 month of usage one earpod is not working and they have zero customer support. For the price you pay you expect them to atleast provide good customer service but to my surprise it has none.I would strongly recommend everyone to not waste their money on this over priced product.
Very good range. You can just go for this blindly. It will not fall off as long as you don't shake your head violently for few minutes 😜
"Bad service experience. When one side is noy working I clamied for warrenty. They took all things I get with purchase But returns only airdops and charging box. They didnt return my size rubbers, data cable, bill, warranty card, box etc. I need that too much specially size rubers."
while listening music on laptop it suffers a lil problem.. but with mobiles they are awsome 100%working .even 1 charge life is more than 5 hrs acc. to my experience ..well the product is not bad in just 1600(i had a vocher by boat from previous purchases) i love it. and 1 more thing the boat logo on then are not acute red as shown in pics .. its faded red logo....else is great.
Not satisfied with product quality. The right earpiece stopped working just after few days. Everytime you have to reset and restart it again for use. Sometimes the device is not automatically detected. Now I am also unable to take calls with this. One should not expect this from brand like boat. Worst experience.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The sound quality is awesome no objection. BASS is higher ... But if you are a bass lover you will love it.The noise cancellation is at its best also the battery life is decent.While talking on phone tried both airdopes and single also.....no problems the other person can hear you very well."
"Sound quality is ok not great , bass was not as expected but ok , there was some problems , suddenly one earphone stopped playing so i had to reset it then it was solved .Not comfortable started ear pain, and head ache  , and can't use it for an hour , i had received it today so i will soon post a review after using for some daysEdit : 2 day i found that the touch function is not good because it is only good for pause and play , to play next song double tap function is not working properly , when we double tap the pause function is working which is not good ."
Hello! Who ever is reading this review.First of all I want to tell you all that if have budget of these you can buy these BOAT AIRDOPES 441. Without any doubt because it is having so much nice quality of sound quality I have ever heard with high bass and so many functions and One good thing about them is that they don't drop very easily if they got fit in your easily .Thank you!!!!👌100/100
"Left side ear bud is not charging properly. It shows charged fully and after a few mins of use (say 15 mins), if you turn it off, it shows it is insufficiently charged. Once you put back for charging, within a few mins, it shows fully charged!!! What's more, there is no service center in Rajkot where this was delivered as a gift. Never buying this product or any other product from Boat."
"Sound quality and bass quality is nice .but it slips from ear.not comfortable as compare to NU/Oneplus Airpods.Cannot talk properly on call using product. The person on other side barely hear us...and if we use it while walking it will fall down several time .Not happy with the product . trusted on Amazon , butbits not done"
"Battery life is very poor, can listen for like 20 mins. The touch control is over sensitive so pauses , skips , disconnets call, accidentally. Mic is actually not at all usable, we have to shove inside mouth for the other person to hear any voice"
All is good but i face same asissint all time not work properly. Actually when device is off then i active assistant its activities but activities sound not soundble so i not understand my assistant was active.and some time assistant totally not work and here my voice issue but again i try its work. Its some software problem. But otherwise if you are not using assistant this is the very good product for us
"Updated my review, If you are willing to buy this for hours of calling then its useless ,it have very bad noise cancellation which irritates the person other side of the call."
Amazing product available out there...!!Best sound quality and battery at an affordable price would definitely recommend this..The case is small and compactGlitchfree operations.Everything is excellent.Just due to rubber ear experience a small pain but other rubber solves the problem
Sound quality is ok but right one stopped workig after return period. I thought it would be nightmare to get it fixed however service center simply replace it which means:Either they are customer centric which does not looks to beOr product is third class but they are simply ensuring to get it replacedBetter to buy better brand
"Cons:- Very low sound quality, hardly hear voice even when device volume is set at max.- Getting ear pain and headache when used it for an hour- Could not be detected from all devicesI was already using BoAt wired earphone which was good.. But I didn't expect this quality from BoAt airdopes and Unsatisfied overall.. Not recommended until quality improves.."
Feel pain in ears while long duration of use on sigle charge the battery backup is approx 5-6 hrs .sound quality is descent bass is good but noise cancellation is not goodDue to dual mic  people on another side experience lot of voice of surrounding's while calling
"Product is good in sound but didn't reach expectation, there is an issue with connectivity and sound while calling.Even after replacing the product I am facing the same issues.I want to return this product and want my amount to be refund back."
"Good sound quality for the price, and great battery life.Only issue is that the earphones randomly keep getting disconnected from my phone.UPDATE: Absolutely useless. Disconnects 4-5 times per call. Don't even try to take any important call with them. You'll miss most of it."
Connectivity is really bad and it cuts off suddenly. I thought the product's star rating is good and some people might be having this problem but these are really uncomfortable to wear and also really bad connectivity. Sound quality and bass quality is ok but due to the connectivity and uncomfortably fit of this product this is the worst and I have been using it for some days bought it recently it's not even been 2 weeks.
Its very good for my studies. It has  good quality sound.
"Product is good but if your looking it for calls it is not use full for that, sound quality is good and bass isbalso good, iam not saticified with battery, onve full charhed it will last for only 3 hours if you play music continusly, if you use it for calls u can use it for 3.5 hours, iam dis appoinyed with battry backup. With the case you can charge for 3 to 4 times."
U cannot obviously expect too much from this price range. Its a decent product with normal sound quality. Can be bought if you don’t listen to music much n use it for a very long time.  I first received a used one but then got a replacement of the same.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The producut is very nice. Its sound quality is superrb. No ear pain or other distarctions . But the case is a little big and difficult to kept in pocket. You can use for about 20 full charges with charging case for one time"
"I was a fan of Boat products until I used the one myself, it worked find for 15 days and then one airdopes started disconnecting frequently and one day boom it stopped working, because of Covid issue I couldn't use the warranty as it was lockdown period.So my 2500 was completely wasted, I won't suggest buying it"
"In less than a year of mostly light to moderate use, one bud has lost its battery life. Cannot depend on it. Moreover it is not durable even physically. Some silver covering that's supposed to be stuck over the sound output part of the bud was removed on its own. Also ears (pinna) hurt during use over half an hour due to the silicon covering meant for grip and stable placement in ear."
"Sound quality is good but not excellent. Battery back up is good enough. After approx one year of use, one side stop working. As its warranty period expired they denied replacement. So I asked for service center in Baroda they did not replied. Add on I did not find any details of service center in Baroda. So I could not repair it and now this product is useless for me. So buy only genuine brand product."
"Really nice quality earpods compared to the expensive ones. Listening for music is great and the touch controls work really well. There are sensitive enough. If you accidentally turn over to one side while lying in bed, they tend to pause. Haven't tested the mic quality yet."
It's value for money product and if any one is looking for ear buds they should go with boAt Airdopes 441 Pro TWS
"Charging not working,  voice quality appeared to be fair.Not working since the charging is not working., charging connector is poor quality (USB C type).Can not sustain even normal or rare use."
"It's been a good experience with these earphones! It's a lil fancy and the charger cum box for the earphones are impressive! I got it for 2.5k so it's a steal! The only problem is it hurts my ear after wearing for long, that's the reason for 4 star and not 5!"
Pros:- The sound is okay for this price.- The connectivity is okay.Cons:- The touch do not work properly.- The fit is very poor. Your ear would hurt no matter what size do you use.- The light on the case is always lit.
"sound quality, Better price, and even noise cancellation is too gud. Easy to use and battery also not drain very fast . Gud product"
"Best product for the price range, however there is a noticeable latency on bluetooth because of which I have given 4.The eardopes fit snug into the ear, and just won't come offI have bathed in them and nothing happened."
"Things I liked- Good bass ,fast connectivity, LED lights that shine around the earphones when not connected,Cool look and overall good sound quality for this price point.Things not liked- Not a very comfortable fit it starts to itch after 30-45 mins continuous use, Not meant for Android Gaming (as it doesn't support Aptx codec on Bluetooth) the lag in sound is around 200-300ms."
"The product looks very good. Nice packing, the container / charging box is very neat and well designed. The dopes fit well in the ear. However the audio quality is inconsistent and needs a lot of improvement. I will switch back to using head phone for my official calls."
Pros:Perfect during workout and market areas.Noise cancelling feature is good.Design wise 4/5. Does not fall off ear.Battery 4/5 my typical usage 2 hrs a day still lasts for a week.Sound quality good.Cons.Nothing major as such.Better options available in the price range.
"Loved the colours, fit is good, not exactly noise cancellation but the sound quality bass and even the microphone quality is good. My ears feel a bit heavy though after using it for more than an hour. Otherwise a good product."
Super fast delivery by Amazon.Sound quality absolutely amazing....for bass lovers ...there cant be anything better.Calling is just fine...already loving this product.Need to use it for a few more days.....will update on the battery back up....First impression.......excellent.
The buds soumded ok in beginning but slowly an irritating sound started in right bud which increased very much in 1 month and the sound also started in left bud by time which makes it very irritating to listen music or watch any video
"I encountered only one issue, if used for long duration continuously then ears starts painining.Some improvement in this regard can be done.Rest all the features of product are very good including battery life."
"Not very comfortable to use1. You cannot use for more than 30 min at once ,there will be discomfort and ear pain.feeling of very heavyness.2. Touch is so sensible every time you want to adjust , you may pause audio, disconnect call ,3. Balance between both the earbuds is not proper.4. You will face disconnection while in movement like jogging, exersise etc."
gameplay..❤ Special for pubg loversBlue color awsm gameplay with no lag of soundToo good 😍Value of money..🔥
Everything about the product is very good. Got it under 2.5k so that's a very good catch. Also sometimes the earpods connect immediately to the phone but the sound doesn't come. So for that u have to disconnect the BT and reconnect again and it works fine again. Apart from that everything about the product is very good. Fully Satisfied!
Boat Airdopes exceeded my expectations. In their price the quality these TWS devices is pretty good. The size is a little bigger than what looks in the image. The build quality is great. The sound is really amazing for the mids and lows and the high notes are decent as well. The bass and treble is balanced. Overall a good product at its price range.
"Terrible product. I have been fooled . This is not what people expect from Amazon. I got a defective product,and on top of that it's battery performance is extra terrible.Left earpiece isn't working, right earpiece gives terrible and broken sound. I am definitely going to bin this product because if I return this, they will sell it to someone else and they will end up losing their money just like me."
I go through the review of this item and Had purchased this in last month and in the box I have received only charging case without the ear buds. Have raised the concern with Amazon customer support and still I am waiting for the resolution even I contacted 3 time for the update and every time they are saying the same thing that our team will contact you soon. God only knows when the day will come...
Sound quality is good and the built is also very good plus the battery backup is excellent 👍🏼For the price value its goodI got it for 2500
"The product is good.Initially I had a problem in syncing between the left and right pods! Noisy and automatically disconnecting often!Later I initiated for replacement, the new product was all good with all the issue fixed!Pretty good! But the mic has a issue usually. The other person always says the voice is feeble to hear!Apart from that I don’t see any issue!"
"Pros:- Sound quality. Good for Bass lovers- Fits really well in earsCons:- Keeps on disconnecting on Macbooks - Tried on 2 laptops but same result. Works well with iPhone.- Mic isn’t good while using with laptop. Opponents keep on complaining about distorted or low voice.- after ~1 .5 month of usage, case battery is ~10hrs."
"Often we compromise on quality by buying cheap products. In this case, it is just not worth it.Would strongly suggest going in for a better product. Almost always one of the ear pieces stops working and you have to dip into the charger to make it work.Easily ranks as one of my worst online purchases"
"Like- Battery backup, Sound, Bass, Lights, Touch function on call receiving and song next and prev function, DurabilityDislike- Only one that need to improve, Calling function not as much good as expected and when we on call with and like we speaking from more away from our microphone."
"Updating review after use a week.The Airpods is super, Boat is maintaining the brand value by providing products like this.Amazing sound, Easy to fit in ears, Excellent Noise cancellation, Design is outstanding.with you whole day in one charge.Best for Gym, Cycling, exercise and outdoor games.Best of Sound lovers."
"I have replaced the one which I bought in offer, the second item I received was worst than the earlier one. Left airdopenot worked, not charged. Very much disappointed. Useless product... Negative points for this product..."
Not expecting this performance with boat... not a value for money product.... n remember guys this product doesn't do noise cancelation as per customer service of amazon... if u want a feature of noise cancelation then don't buy this 🙏
Loved the design and sound is also good. All the specifications and features mentioned in product description are true.  Happy
"It started out as a very nice product, a little on the bulkier side. However, a month into this, I have started facing a few glitches and bugs. A few connectivity issues but all over good product."
"Connects to phone's bluetooth seamlessly. I use it every morning during jogging. It's very comfortable to wear and has a decent sound quality. Microphone is good in quiet places, but I have not yet used it in noisy environment."
Awesome for listening music however during call u will come across some kind of small glitches which is ignorable..
"The sound is good, design and quality of the charging box and earbuds seems nice. Sometimes there is a issue in connecting but after couple of tries ot putting back in the box works fine. The fit for the ear could have been better with one additional fitting"
"sound quality is good even the base is high ( you really want that too), besides the charging gets faster and the case has a lot battery a lot so It's recommended to have these. Noise cancelation feature is there, even at half the sound you will feel it. And the base quality is really good, it means it perfectly mends with the sound and it doesn't messes with that"
It is a very good product I have good experience on it so you can buy this for a best airpods I think I you can buy in dasara in great Indian festival I got for 2000 ruppess it will connect to all phones iPhone also actually apple airpods is 15000 but this only 2000 ruppess so every one buy this I have been green And white colour so every buy this product I am very happy to buy this best airpods 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
"My experience with this product was pathetic even after replacing it twice.In the first place it took almost 20 days to replace the product and moreover the same problem with the first remained in second one, if you use single earpiece on a call one of the two earpiece will slow down a lot and then this will continue happening alternatively. Not even solved after factory reset. I would have given it -5/5 stars"

 It worked perfectly for a few days. Later left AirPods started giving wired sound. It stopped connecting to the phone and giving weird sound. Like “tin tin tin tin”. It’s not working. Hopeless investment. Please buy from a authorize store. Avoid buying from Amazon no service provided."
"I have bought at 2000 but within week now available at 1500, this is not good merchandizing practice, MRP circa 6000, this misleading, very ordinary sound don't buy above 1000, it is an inferior product"
I have purchased it in May end. But it’s not working properly the left ear peace is getting heated up and gives a vibrating sound all the time and sound volume is very feeble making it impossible to use absolute waste of moneyPlease advise where can I get service and what about the warranty
"This is horrible for your ears in every area like comfort, sound, durability and more."
My warranty got expired while followup  for service. I thrown into dust bin and purchased good branded.product. If u r looking product for very very short term u can consider this or else please by some good product for service support.
"Its really good. One time, while exercising, some sweat went into the left bud, and its voice got a bit low. I send for replacement to boat and it came back better, also if same happens with you, put it in sunlight, it will be normal as usual. Everything else is just awesome."
"Satisfied buyer here. Sound quality is not bad for the price range, the bluetooth range and connectivity is awesome. Battery is pretty amazing, you can last a whole day with a single charge. The only drawback for me is the supersensitive touch panels. You'll probably face problems while sleeping 😴 on your sides, you've got to place your ears in such a way that it doesn't stop your music player 😅"
Sound quality is really good. Look wise it is super awesome..  You'll get charging cable and extra buds with this. Calling quality quite okay Bluetooth connection everything is good with this.  This is really really amazing one. Battery backup is also good. After using hours it charges within minutes. You can never expect such quality at this price.Please go for it. Without any doubt.
"I bought this for myself and have used them for sometime. The sound quality is very good. Clear sound. But, not very good in noise cancellation and bass is just normal. Don't expect headphone quality great bass. In a nutshell, value for money.."
It's only been 29 days and the left ear bud runs out of power while the right has 60% left.. Even tho both were at 100%..I'm so angry that now I have to waste time visiting service centre.Do not buy! You'll regret it
Writing it after about two years of usage. Audio quality is good with high bass. But call quality is downright bad. It catches the ambient noise more than your own voice.Build quality is good. It comes with a sturdy case. The case and the earphones both hold charge for a decent amount of time.Go for it if calling is not your priority.
"I have had used many buds but this is the first one with the voice clarity during calls. If you are looking for professional tws with clear calling, go blindly. Bass is 4/5 but I don't care much as abous bass as first priority is calling. Many reputed brands and few others tws from the same brand has failed to provide such clarity."
"Everything is fine, sound quality is to good, even it is 6mm driver bass is to good, but a small prob with sound is low somewhat u can change settings in Equalizer for better loud sound u can blindly purchase it. I had used boat 381, realme buds Q, noise groove and returned all above finally satisfied with this"
"This is an average ears pods. I am using this since 3 months now. There are lot of connectivity issues with other devices, especially when its connected to laptops. The bass is average and sound quality is also ok ok. However there is nothing as noise cancellation in this. But for normal daily usage its works fine."
Product is good. Battery backup is amazing. But the only problem is placing of eardopes into the case is a problem bcos it will not get charged everytime. So we have to make sure it gets charged when we place in the case.
I tried everything to connect these with each other but not happening. Can anyone tell me how it will work. Only one side working at a time.
"If you are fond of listening to music without a second thought you can go for this but for calls it is not at all advisable.  Noise cancellation option is not at all available, so ppl on the other end will not hear ur voice clearly and noise while in call will be more"
"Great sound at this price point, good balance of bass and treble. Vocal is also good. Don't expect quality of BOSE. Only drawback I see is after using it for 1hr or so, the ears start paining, could be a fit issue for my ear only. However I do not use it for long hours so not a deal breaker for me. People who use earphones for long hours should try it from a shop before buying it. Sound quality wise no doubt it is great."
Don't buy worst product.  Exactly goes bad after 7 days. One side is not working.  Shame on Amazon for selling such substandard product.. and the customer care is the worst in the world.  You can neither call them not will respond to emails. Don't but boat products ever.
I bought this earbuds a week ago and it is working without a single charge hence for battery it 100% worth it.Sound quality is also good but for calling it is not that good I can say it 70%Don't even think of using call's using laptop it is horrible.I found one more issue i it when you pickup the call using devices instead of buds it keep ringing parallel with the caller voice.Now its its your choice 😀
Best one which you can buy  at this cost don't hesitate just buy it
Please don't purchase the bota products because boat service quality is very poor I had purchase boat Airdopes 441 in July 2020 now I am facing sound issue. I trying to contact customer service since days but unable to contact him. Also I am trying to complaint on boat online portal but unable to upload the invoice.
"Bad product. The bluetooth connectivity doesn’t even work. Since i have purchased it, it connected just once.. after that it was useless. Tried factory restting multiple times but no use. Also the ear fir is really bad. The in ear buds are of low quality and don’t fit properly. Overall not a product worth putting money into."
"These are good earphones in the given price range. Looks good, performs quite as expected. Hasalle free removal, charging connection etc. Little uncomfortable for ears (at least for me) if used continously for long duration."
The best out there....the price has been dropped down to 2K frm 2.5K...... the sound is better than ny friggin' headset.....the bass is just the perfect amount....and the no issue in connectivity....moreover if anything happens to it....you have a 1 year warranty to replace it.....its the best
It's been a month i am using this airdrops and now writing reviewsOverall performance is too goodBass Quality: It is really nice.Sound quality: As expectedNoise cancellation: It performs well in case of mobile phones but for laptops need to speak loudly. For receiver it feels the voice is coming from distance.
"This airdopes 441 is really good if a man wants to purchase for workout, running ,movie viewing and others then I recommend you can purchase it. Please don't wear it when you are going to driving, out side running, marketing. Bass and sound quality is awesome of boat 441 .when you will  wear this airdopes then automaticlay your ears will  close before you play song. This airdopes of boat 441  comes with bast industry."
"All features are excellent,Sound is Perfect, Noise Cancellation is Excellent, Calls are easy to handle, Can Stop/Play + Google assistant feature.But you cannot use it for long, These are way too big so your ear's start to hurt after some time. Also, Only connects to 1 device at a time.Hope it helps."
Product is not the same as expected.very disappointed.I've ordered about 1000's of orders till now from family accounts but never get wrong product till now but this is the first time I got the defective product and it's really not trustworthy anymore. What to say.. and I didn't checked other shopping apps but today I installed another app and ordered the same product with the lower rate.
I ordered this thrice i get the perfect one on 3rd time .The last 2 was defective and i noticed some disturbing sound chrrr chrrr on lower volume.But on 3rd time this airdopes works perfectly and the sound was actually good and clr and the base was also good definitely worth it .Thank you seller and amazon 🙂
Very good Product.Why?1. Value for money2. Excellent ear grip.3. Top class sound quuality. Happy with its bass.You may think no ANC means cheap but as ear grip is outstanding so no need of ANC. The airdopes itself clears 60-70 % surrounding noise.Finally I am recommending this product without any doubt.For me it was great buy.Thanks Boat.Thanks Amazon.
The bass is very good but vocals are not very clear it has a light vibrating vocals it is un noticable but its a very good product . coming to battery life and connectivity its pretty good
"Good for Android phone. Have iphone xs max and not working well. Keep disconnecting during calls and quite annoying. For Android phone also before connecting blue tooth shall be ON.. For any challenge in bluetooth connection , airdopes need to kept in docks.  Ok bluetooth airdopes."
"Very good sound quality but there is a problem while talking to someone on calls that its mic is very much far from mouth hence we need to speak loudly while having a callEdit: I'm using this for more than 6 months and now the right ear buds battery discharges a lot faster than the left one, I don't know why this happening."
"It's a fantastic product while using music and watching videos. It's usually great while on call but sometimes disconnects and reconnects during calls. This is the only drawback. Else, it's a great product. Since, I don't have many calls therefore I find the product useful."
"It's is like random Chinese products, if it goes fine then it's ok, else if some issue occur forgot your product their warranty is pathetic.. You will receive faulty product always from service center."
I lost my one dops in deep water and found after long search I thought it’s gone now but it’s still giving me a. Powerful performances.Thanks Amazon and happy with Boat.
"Got it for 1699/-. Sound quality is pretty good. Bass is phenomenal. Give u a snug fit. Battery backup is not up to mark as mentioned on the box(5hrs) it only gives u a back up of hardly 3 hrs. Overall, its a good product in this price range far more better than realme buds air which costs 3999/-. A HUGE THUMBSUP FOR BOAT."
Awesome productSound quality superrBluetooh connectivity instantBluetooh Range more than 10-15mtrsBass lovelyBattery backup atleast 3-4hrsCalling fearures addonSuper fit in ears
"It worked very good for 6 months BUT after that left earpiece was sounds too low.I replaced it BUT still the quality is not good as compared to the previous one.A little sound (like a radio noise) is there in the background when you just connect the airdopes with the device and not playing anything on it.Also, it doesn't support to my Mac."
"Music wise it's perfect ,very fast connect to the blutooth devices but very poor over call , you need to speak very loud , good fit in ear but not perfect as sometimes it's falls from ear."
The sound quality is good / bass is fine .If you want to buy this product essentially for calls ..pls don't buy as the call connectivity and voice clarity is not at all good....the voice keeps breaking up and the person on the other end of the call cannot hear you properlyIf you want to spend money to listen to music then you can choose this item but not for hassle free calls
The Design of the product is very nice including the charging case. Good color selection. I have the Bumblebee one.The Bass quality is good for a bluetooth in ear type earphone.However the Mids and highs of the earphone are average.Connectivity is amazing.Battery is good.Mic is average.Touch controls are very good.Overall for the price - BUY IT!
Every thing is good according to price only mic is little disturbing when on call . Must buy product compare to other in this price range .I am reviewing after 2 weeks of purchase .
"Sound quality was good, but no use for calling. Other side person will hear the noise and echoing sound.Don't go for it if you're looking for calling"
It was easy to sync with devices. The sound quality is good. To realise the better base needs to increase the volume more than 70%. Sometimes un sync and sync of a single ear bud is happening for a second. Good looking and perfectly fitting on the ear. Charge holds for a longer time to watch movies.
"A really great product at this price. It's super convenient, is lightweight and easily fits in the ears and does not feel heavy or irritable even after using continually for a couple of hours. It's design and materials used also feel and look premium. The product, especially at this price point, exceeded my expectations"
Its a good TWS overall ..Positive:- Good sound Quality n Bass- Built is good.- Reasonable n worth the price.Negative:- I started facing issue with Bud connectivity within 10 days - I think that can happen to any product though.- Touch is too sensitive.- Not too sure on the longevity of overall product.
"Unfortunately I am returning this product because my left ear is paining a lot! Sound quality is decent but if you're seeking for high bass then these airdopes are not suggested for you. After 2-3 hours of use your ears will start paining, although it depends on person to person!!! If you're buying these airdopes for gaming purpose then I would recommend you to not buy it at any cost! Overall decent airdopes."
"Good quality sound. Bass is very good, you get spatial sound effects. Battery life is great. After 15 days, still 50% battery left. Around 90 minutes usage per day for me."
"I like these TWS, but these have some problems as mentioned.Bluetooth connection Is not stable between ear buds and causes reduction in internet speed with Wi-Fi and this connected simultaneously. sound stage is too warm or base heavy(Not my favorite Taste), sound accuracy and balance is mediocre.Earbud fitting in case is bit problematic as earbuds sometimes do not charge when placed in case, placing earbuds perfectly has to be ensured for charging."
"Very irritating. Even after I replaced it, sometimes only one piece works the other doesn't. Major flaw is with the design. The face of the earphone is the touch button, it cut the call with even little touch. So once you are on call you cannot adjust the earphones as it gets cut."
"The sound quality and everything was good but I was very disappointed to recieve a defective product not once but twice. The first time there was an issue with the right earplug, which was producing a continuous buzzing sound. So I requested for a replacement. To my disappointment, the new piece was also defective. The earplugs were fine but the charging case has lost its magnetism and kept opening. So I finally gave up and returned the product."
"After few days of use, the eardopes stopped working.I requested for replacement from Amazon, as it was under the replacement time line. Now today again the eardopes have stopped working without any reasons.This is really not acceptable.Customer care number of Boat is not reachable. Only way to communicate is by online complaint. Their TAT is 15days.... Really not acceptableIt's almost 22days... I'm yet to get any confirmation..."
"Have been using the product for almost 2 months :Pros :- Comfortable- doesn’t fall off- good build quality- Sound quality is good- battery Charge remains for 3 hours at one go .Cons :- Bass is less , So not the right product for people who enjoy music at high volume and high bass- mic noise cancellation is just satisfactory,not crystal clear ."
Works well in the first couple of months. After that one of the buds stops working. Got it replaced and then it was the same case with the replacement as well. I suggest you don't buy as there are not many Boat service centers available as well.
"It's groovy, and amazing but sadly I have to give 3 out of 5 because of 1 thing which is its calling features.Mic sucks big time, when you talk person has to talk loud and then also next person can't hear you clean even in slightest of noise around.boAt would excel if they would work on improving their calling feature/soudn quality and mic.Overall it's great button to wear on while workout but drastically fails on calling features."
"No doubt it is a boat product, the sound and bass Quality is best...Noise cancellation is pretty good...Bluetooth connection is also great..The best part is the battery backup...I am using these airdops since last 2 months. Once fully charged, I can easily use them for around 14 days, even I used to use them for 5-6 hours/day...Absolutely great battery backup..."
"After the only in 8-9 months, left earbud not working properly. It is not suitable for some apps because of Sound delay/lag problem Specially for gaming apps. Otherwise sound quality is good. I claimed my warranty and replaced it but it seems like duplicate product. Also it removed now ""Made in P.R.C"" tag from product. Hence its prove Chinese products are ""Chale To Chand Tak Nahito Rat Tak"". The customer care number which is given is not answering so it was very annoying for register warranty claim or complaint."
Nice product. Battery life of almost 5 hrs in single use. Feels like a premium earbud.Good Sound clarity and Bass. Touch sensor is very much responsive. Fit is comfortable but that can vary for different ear sizes.Bought at Rs2499 on Prime day sale.cons:  Some unwanted noise from the left ear bud is noticeable when no music is playing.
"The quality of the product is goodThe sound and bass quality is also goodThe range is also pretty decent, upto 6-8 meters.The call quality is decent, however the people on the other side can't hear or hear low voice in different platforms like MS Teams, Zoom calls, If you are buying this TWS for only meetings and online classes, I wouldn't recommend it, otherwise it's perfectly good."
Only biggest problem with the product is touch feature is a bit problematic as a little touch while adjusting the earpiece may disconnect the call. Otherwise all other features are good. Battery back-up is also good.
"The sound quality is fare enough, base and noice cancellation are also good..The problem I have with the product is1. connect issue: sometimes teh quick auto connection don't work...2. The hold of the airpodes is not great... After sometime it starts falling .."
The sound quality is great. The bass is also good if the buds are inserted a little deeper into the ear.The only issue would be the interference with the wifi signal if wifi is at 2.4 ghz. I did not face any interference at 5ghz.I have tried this on Redmi and Oppo phones.
"Just such an amazing product.... great sound quality, bass, touch controls, and passive noise cancellation... Beautiful dual tone look with a sturdy Matt black finish on the case... lasts really long... goes head to head with my jabra elite active 65Ts and my AirPods 2nd Generation"
"It was an assume product which I get mrng, and I gone through it, the sound was pretty good and noise cancellation was good and it was a single touch buttons are so good to control the previous tarcks, sound volume, next track songs..When it is come to calling opponent voice was so clear to listenTotaly the product was is just assum product and i am happy for it"
"Very very good product seemless performance  with very bright and good look. Colour combinations of light indicator  are very good . Touch response is very good . Bass is nice . Sound quality is seemless . And battry life is neither sooo good nor sooo bad (Inshort soso).And main thing is that ,it has Type C port for charging case ."
"I have had these for six months and already the left one has stopped playing. I have reset the pods multiple times, restoring factory settings but nothing helps. The left one still gets power but there’s no sound coming out. The pair is now useless because it’s disorienting having sound from just one side and defeats the purpose of having music from noise-cancelling pods going in the gym."
I have been using this headset for the past 6 months and have no complain. The product is just Amazing. Worth for the money. The best Bluetooth headset you will get for Rs.2500/-
"Not good for taking calls. There is lot of latency. Even simple calls over internet has lag, call drop, breaks. Not phone calls receiver complains of echo and voice not clear. Can be used as earphones to watch movie."
"Recently I bought this pair of boat airdopes 441, and the voice gets muffled when I attend online classes, I expected to use it in online classes but the voice gets muffled.I hear static and buzzing noises when I play a song...and the biggest thing to note is that the boat team is not picking up my calls and not even replying to my e-mails.I am really dissatisfied whit the boat team:(I beg you guys to contact me soon."
Noise cancellation is not so much effective.But overall sound quality is good.Would say average productEar pain happens with long day use due to big size of ear buds.
Within a week issue started.One side volume is not coming . Tried all troubleshooting but issue not resolvedBOAT custmer care is not approachable.Dont know how  to get repair ???
This product which I got had two seals one above another and the second one was broken already and the first one which I openedBeside that no other default is there the product works properly plus sound quality is okThus the second seal makes me a little uncomfortable that if the product has any default in future
I ordered it at 1799₹..and use it for like a week and this is what I think  Nice look  No need of that flag like appearance on airpod( just for show)  Long wear can cause ear pain until you will normalised with it  No noise cancellation  Baas is ok  Sound quality is ok(not that good as I think)  Touch response is goodSeems like good product
LikesGood music and bassHad to switch to a smaller wing to get a comfortable fitDislikesStatic noise present when not playing music or using the budsCharging case lighy system could be better
Best in the market for the first time tws users. Simply change your  ear tips for your taste......the boat 441 rocks.......🤩🤩🤩🤩. Last but not least........small ear tips for treble  lovers.........Large one for Bass lovers........and medium ear tips for balanced sound........go ahead......👍👍👍
This is best ear buds in this price range. I was lucky to buy it during festival offer. They do not hurt ears being soft and comfortable. Clips help them to grip firmly on ear lobes so no fear of losing them. I had bought many expensive ear buds but these are the best
Yadi  music sunne ko lena hai to le sakte but clling quality 1 dam gathiya hai mera to mood karab ho gaya bcz office me beth kar ya kisi public places par ap bat hi nai kar sakte kyoki jab loudly bolo tab mic se awaj jati hai other wise samne wale ko voice hi nai sunai deti  isse acha nackband hai yar I'm requesting to boat ki yar mice quality to achi to rate to ap acha khasa le rahe ho
"1. For claiming warranty, I am being asked to visit their service center 25 kilometers away. No home pickup.2. Left and right buds don't connect properly and gives irritation as sometime sound will come some time not.3. The buds doesn't gets charged properly and we will have to keep on trying to fit it multiple times to charge it"
Nice base with good sound. Playback time is good.quick charging capacity. Pocket friendly in a small case. Type-c charging cable available.Sound quality goid at 75 volume. Over bass in full sound. Good product..like it.☺️
"Faulty Unit. Not even six months.... The box stopped charging. Boat was prompt in responding (within 1 year warranty) and picked it up for repair/replacement. Feb 21However, to my Shock and DISAPPOINTMENT they replaced 441TWS (IPX7 rated, 30 hour box backup) with 431 (IPX4 rated, 10 hour box backup). Raised the issue again in Mar 1st week...it was taken back.(17 Mar21) Today it was replaced with the same tier Air Buds.Happy to have them back... 🙂"
Excellent buy. I am happy with the quality of the product. A minor usability issue. I use it while walking and when I try to wipe sweat with hand towel accidentally the touch pauses/plays the music. This is an intended feature but there should be a way to disable/enable the capacitative touch. Another observation is that the single charge do not last 5 hours as promised. It comes to around 2-3 hours..
Good sound quality with bass..Nice packing and finishing of the product..2 charging options - USB Port and Type C Port..Easy to connect via Bluetooth..
Sound quality is third class and very costly I purchased this product if we talk about noise cancellation and bass quality is also 3rd class and not fit properly (very loose & some time feel pain) & not comfortable in ear if you are thinking to purchase this product I suggest you that after I am using this please don't purchase any model of boat airbuds not only this.Thanks
"I have not expected this from Amazon fulfilled product, Worst Experience.I have received faulty piece - 1 ear pod was not at all  working, raised the replacement on 22nd November and Yet the new product is not yet dispatched. Horrible experience with this worst product and experience with Amazon.Don't buy this product ever"
Value for money. Sound quality is also good. Only drawback is that it’s manufactured in China.
"Worst mic ever. Everything goes to zero due to mic quality. My refund period got over, i wish i could return these, is it possible? Directly to boat maybe. anyone has any idea?If u dont need mic then its ok. But not worth spending 2k for this then. They are comfortable to wear, grip is not very strong but ok.. might slip from ears after every 1hr.. or if exercising then 15mins. Sound quality is good."
"Brilliant in design, Comfort and battery backup!Have just charged it once from the day i got it delivered.The case seems to be a little flimsy, which can be ignored if you are person who can handle with care. Otherwise, just blindly go for this if you're looking for a budget true wireless headesets with good performance!"
"This one the best product in boat it’s cheap and the sound quality is very good. No complaints. I brought noise, boat airdopes 511v these to had lot of complaints it wasn’t fitting in hear. This product fits in ear. Amazing product loved it. It’s worth.🔥"
I think the one I got from offline was much better in battery backup as compared to this one!  It can’t even stay up to 3 hrs if not kept back on charging. No doubt boat is a damn good company but I guess this one was a defective piece and I can’t replace it as well now... so pls check and then pay
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It doesn't has a battery indicator..which we really need. I'm experiencing like it's not working properly or it is not working sometimes but it works after I reset it twice or thrice,which is an issue!..the buds overheat if over charged for some mins...its not for pubg gaming or any online gaming cuz it has lags...it doesn't work after few weeks ..there r lot of errors ."
"Build quality is good but sound quality is worst i am tried boat 225 sound and bass not like this please do not waste money I am impressed due to amazon choice but i can't like this This earphone comapred with  jblc100 and sannhieser street180 and boat 225 ,250 but sounds not like this"
Although it produces good bass and sound... but after watching the online reviews I had bought these and was disappointed about the latency in games... its too much. It came to my surprise that how such latency can come in 2500-3000 prize range headphones.. I am very much disappointed. I replaced the item one time and same thing happened
"Worst product, left earpiec was not working, sent for replacement twice.. The replaced item also is having the same problem. Going to send it for the third time. I have had this piece replaced thrice and still the left earpiece only works for few days and then goes dead. Now the warranty period of 1 year is over now the Boat441 is gone to the dustbins"
"The product is too good not to buy. Compatible with all devices including iPhones. Worth the price too, got it for 1,799/-The case is all v good, charging is also fast, fits properly in the ears if put in properly. Magnets fitted inside the case are v helpful too! Sound is smooth, blocks background noise v well. Can receive calls too. Have found no issues at all as of yet!"
"High notch sound quality, bass is good, noise cancelation is ok but mic performance is poor especially in traffic.As I give more preference to call quality ordered for return within 3 days.For the past 5 days I'm waiting for the return and none contacted so far.Will update...Edit:Returned the product and refunded within a week"
Got them today.. sound quality is okay bass is good. Built is really bad with shiny plastic nothing to flaunt. Right one at full volume has a hissing sound like it will die if I continue playing at full. Will check for another day if it worsens I'll get replaced. All n allSound 7/10Bass 8/10Built 5/10
I bought this product recently from the seller. And the product came out to be defective with hissing or static noise in left ear bud and that is really annoying. I waited for a week to get this product delivered to me and that was the result. If u read some previous reviews you will notice that it is not just my particular earbuds but the whole line of boat eardopes is defective so avoid getting anything by boat now specially wireless.
Rewriting the review after 2 months of use. Right sided giving prob. Intermittently stops working and recently it's giving prob during calls while audio works well
"I had to return twice due to defective pieces. I selected these due to brand image, pricing and specifications.I could not commission these. No joy."
"I loved the product and especially the output quality, it was clean, pure and soft, however there is a constant buzzing sound in the left earbud which makes it uncomfortable. I wish it didn't had this buzzing irritating noise."
"I don’t know what you’re looking for, but as a part time music producer I can tell you this bass has too much bass. It’s okay you reduce the bass on Spotify or Apple Music in the EQ section. But still it’s not supposed to be this unwantedly bassy. But apart from that it seems to be a good at everything else, but still if I knew it had this much bass, wouldn’t have bought it. Not sure how much bass you guys like, but be sure to think before you buy."
"Be warned that the Mic on this one is not that great and you have to really speak up to hear. The audio quality overall is of course good, but occasionally it conks out and goes into full on screeching mode and the only solution is to unpair and repair. I have only faced this issue with laptops though and not with my phone, although the mic quality is pretty low on phone as well."
"Impressed with sound quality at this price, but somehow cant use more then 30 minutes, it started paining in ears , it may be my ears design , not for all"
It comes out often from ear.  Not recommended while travelling. Weight is slightly more. Sound quality OK.Charge remains  for long time.Price needs a cut.
I am using this product for 4 months now. Sound quality is awesom comfortable but not that much but can be ignored but the mic is worst u can't use them to answer calls its not only in my piece but my friend face same problem.
This is fantastic product since I have written this review after 4 months using this .overall best earphones
"It's the best air dope with such amazing sound quality. It's totally built for workouts. I can run, jump, lift weights without any worry of dropping them. It fits really well into the ears. 4+ hours battery life once out of the box."
"The product is not worth the value because:1. While connecting to Android device, it disconnects now and then.2. Touch is erratically sensitive, small touch of cloth, hairs disconnects the call. But when we touch actually to disconnect the call it becomes insensitive.3. Sometimes one of the Airdopes disconnects reconnects then disconnects.Very bad experience of product"
The sound and bass were excellent!! But the noice cancellation was not to the mark to what I expected. The product was value for money at this price👌
Nice primium feel ear buds. Got a good deal so would rate for the price. Voice is good and can hear other person clearly. Average for music listeners with a good baas boost. Satisfied with the product. Amazon does its job to deliver btge product sometimes before time. Keep it up Amazon
Performance-wisw these earphones are pure garbage. It can hardly last for 3 hours.Play/pause won't work for smart watches.There's always some white noise when you pause a song.If you can compromise on the aforementioned issues only then you should consider buying them.
Color raging redGot it todayIt is value for money u can buy thisIt has a decent sound and noice cancellation is also decentProduct is very good in looks and soundMic is also decentThe plastic quality is also good
"The product is worth of money in case of sound quality, good bass but a small dip in high mid frequency but it can b solved by a flat eq.. the one thing I feel essential is an a dedicated application just to know the battery percentage of both buds and for tuning* one weak later my right bud  shows low battery only and not charging , now its not working am waiting for the replacement I don’t know is this is an common case"
Best budget earbuds with good sound quality and bass quality with average noise cancellation. One who love to hear music while driving should go for it! Overall nice product!Company origin is Mumbai! But when I purchased i come to know its production is from China; it says made in P.R.C!
I used it for 8 months and then one of it stopped charging . I raised a complaint but they replaced it within 5 days. Terrific. Super fast service . Talking about the headphones themselves . These are really good headphones . They are bass heavy a bit . But you wont notice itDefinately recommend buying
I am using to listen to my favourite songs and watch YouTube and favourite programs on my TV late night without disturbing my other housemates and neighbours. Excellent performance.
"Good overall, but speaker for calls isn't as receptive or good as u would be like it to be, as the other person on the line have difficulty in hearing what we say, often. Otherwise good product for its price."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It has awesome ear fit and great noise cancellation. You can attend call also, but sometimes it can create issue while connecting, but that is just a small glitch which can be fixed when we reconnect or keep the eardoprs back in the lid.Overall , it is best to buy and batery life is good."
"Prime member, Received next day.Writing on 3rd day.Appropriate packaging, comes with charging case, earbuds, S-M-L ear caps, C cable, user manual and 1 yr warranty card.Chose the product by brand and user ratings (4*+) & reviews. All good so far. Will be able to comment on quality after using the product."
"Have to speak with a bit of force and loudly for my voice to be heard clearly, but otherwise great earbuds. I can hear everything very clearly. Long battery life and easy pairing."
"My first TWS earbuds...and definitely say it is a awesome product and i really like it..sound quality is descent but the main feature is the battery backup..if you are heavy user then this is the best product for you..i got this product 1 week ago, using 2 hours daily and still no need to chargeThanks"
This is a great product in this price range. Sound quality and product quality is good. Noise cancelling is also good as of the size of product. Fits in ear well.
"Problem with this earbuds is that sometimes this stays connected to phone even after keeping it in that charger. Also theres a big surprise for you.. it brings you small irritating sound as some aliens machines giving you some signals.. ""i need  dhoop""👽... i replaced this product once but same thing happening again.. otherwise product is awesome."
Right side Airdope doesn't work. It doesn't charge at all even when the Left side gets fully charged. And all this just started afater the return time gets over. At present only one Airdope( Left) one works.Not at all recommended for buying.
Amazing sound quality
"I liked the sound quality of the product.The only thing I disliked is the noise cancellation feature. This cannot be used for calling until you are at a peaceful place,lots of noise."
"Received a defected product, one side ear bud is not working, other ear bud is creating irritational sound.. I received the product but the seal was already opened, completely disappointed with the purchase, it is not refundable, and I applied for replacement. Totally disappointed with overall purchase.. please don't buy any boat products. Waste of time, energy and money. 😟😟"
"Faulty product received and complaint within a day , but customer care says they cannot take return of this product and i only need to send it back to amazon.Really bad service by Amazon , not at all satisfied."
"Reviewing after 2 months of use. The product is just worth it at this price range. Just go for it and it won't disappoint you..Sometimes, it wont connect and that might be frustrating for you. You need to place them back in the case and press both of them long for 3 times to get it restarted, but once it connects then you wont face any issue."
"It's been 5 months I've been using thisWorking great, I'm a music freak to be honest I charge 6 times a week and its absolutely fineDon't compare sound quality with your headphones cz there aren't same.I hv tried a couple of earphones/airpodes this is the best and I'm happy to have itEven though price is little high it's completely worth it wait for some deals and when price falls just go for it"
Love them. Only issue is with the connectivity but it gets resolved using the tips from the manual. They reoccur sometimes but it's manageable. Plus they sometimes hurt the ear after prolonged usage. That's why the four stars. Otherwise they're really good
Amazing sound clarity.. Noise cancellation works very well.. Could find Bass quality in the upper or lower side depending on the user.. Love the fitting..CTC works smoothly.Only down side is unable to control volume from ear buds.. U have to pick up your phone every time you want to adjust the volume..
"First of all it looks so stunning and beautiful. After admiring looks then I go up to performance which is superb and up to the house. Sound quality, bass , noise cancellation every other details which is related to sound is fantastic. And last but not least Feeling of opening case is like opening something royal..."
Product is good but if you purchase something after sale service matter. There service center is not professional. Miss behave with Customers..using boat Products from Years. Airdopes 311 ..441 or 441 pro. Boat Stone speaker . Boat rockers every product is purchased from this account. Of amazon waste of access money will go for one+. Something better with after sale services.
After using 441 for 5 days here is my review !Sound quality and bass is awesome.Battery backup stands upto 3 hours fine !Quick change within 10 minutes I got 35%For calls it's fine totally I'm happy with this product 😊
"there is connectivity problem sometimes,the sound is also not that loud .After listening for some time our ears will pain.the bass is over powered .and some time the sound from left earbud is more than that from right .there is also noticeable pain in the ear after wearing them for some time."
"Really cool headphones with superior quality also the sound is so good it will make dance which indicates the best quality of headphones according to me , totally in love with it ,fits well does not fall..."
One earpods is not  support  properly and battery drain very fast very easily remove automatically from ears n dont know how much have to charged.. it’s a defective product there is a ticking noise on the right ear bud... I want a replacement I don’t want any refunds please help... I can return only u have to given another product on the same time . We have the amount  of ur product  how can I trust once ur executive come take the product  but wat the grantee  of the that issued me another product
"One piece is not working.. Kept under charging for some more time thinking it is first time charging.. But it never worked.. When wanted to return, surprised to see there is no return option"
I am using boat eardopes 441 from 2 months. Product is good but battery life is very bad. They said battery remains upto 25 hours after charging but after use of 5-6 hours of use battery gets blank. Also after use of half an hour ears get hurting. Calling voice quality is also bad. Other person not able to listen properly. It doesn't have return policy after 10 days of purchase it's also bad.Overall it is not a good product.
I have been using it from 2 weeks and really its just awesome product.Sound quality- So goodBass - Also goodNoice Cancellation- Good but maybe better than this.But all over product is just so awesome and reliable for this price. I also suggest you to but this. You won't regret.
Pretty good buds....easy to access nd Perfectly fit in ears.....bass effect is damn damn good....noise cancellation is bit average...not uptown mark.... best thing is this buds comes with power bank.. in an emergency it's a blessing..... overall good product....
Not supporting well when connected to PC and attend a call in zoom app.sometimes the voice will be heard like a radio frequency sound and Mic doesn't work at all.For mobile usage and other things it works well.
"At 1st week it was connecting real quick.but later it started giving trouble.and touch sensitivity is worst it doesn't even work.every time I have to take my phone out to receive calls and to change music..and audio while on call is pethatic..I have a lot of expectations from boat now I'm regreting that why I have selected boat,I should have bought other product instead of boat😤"
Sound quality very good..very high sound..only difficulty I faced is you have to speak in a low voice because it's high in the background. Really appreciate the noise cancellation thing.Easy to use..Got it for 2000..
"The sound quality with the earbus is very good for the price. The power capacity for the case is also exceptional.The only negative thing about these airpods is they hurt your ear hole after about 20 mins of use. The buds fit tightly into the ears, which proves to be sturdy use while exercising, but very uncomfortable and it hurts after long use."
Bad Experience I had earlier getting Nice experience after getting it But after 5.6 days it's not connecting to my device...Then I replace the order & that I got in 2 days only...But after 9.10 days I am facing same problem ...Why it so...Plz solve my issue
I am writing this review after using the product for more than 15 days. The battery does not last for more than 4 to 5 hours.Does not fit into ears falls down very often. And sound quality or noise reduction is not good at all. Sometimes it doesn't even connect to other device also.After 20 days of using it suddenly stopped working it not connected to any device.Overall I can say one of the worst buys I have done. Don't go for this not worth your money.
"It's okay for the price. Not too great or nothing extraordinary. Not preferable for calls, at all. Unless you're habituated to shout on calls. Connectivity is good. Sound quality is also decent. Would've rated 3.5/5 but that half star isn't an option so rating 3."
I got a defective product first.. it lost connection with the phone very often even if the phone is just 300mm (1') away from my ears.. got it replaced ultimatelyThe replacement one has issues too left side capacitive touch is not very responsive it does works sometimes thoughNo major issues other than this
"Left ear dopes not working after replacement date and I tried to replace at Boat based on warranty but now they are saying there is no replacement, waste of money, please don't purchase and don't waste your time and money"
"sound quality,noise cancellation,connectivity...so good. really happy getting this.i got this at 2k. so if you are getting this at 1.5k or under 2k... go for this."
My son loves these. He’s even stopped using his bose headphones due to the ease of use and flexibility these provide. Carries with him everywhere. Will but again without hesitation
"Sounds is good, the best 2 part 5 hours back which 100% 5 hours,Long hour ussess very comfortable...No ear pain.."
"Have been using this for two monthsInitially it was working fineBut now it gets disconnected automatically even when any video is playing.Sometimes i feel like audio get played before audioSound quality is fine but this disconnection causes lot of issues.I am using this with my mac book, i have to disconnect and reconnect it again to make it work."
"Everything is great but have few drawbacks1. Should be careful while driving and touch my interfere, might lose while removing the helmet2. Slight discomfort after using for 1 hr or so3. Touch control is Lil crazy&sensitive."
"Overall the product is good and sterdy enough.  The only thing that bothers me is the mic, that's very poor due to which while an ongoing call the listner is not able to here our voice properly plus there is a constant hissing sound in the earbud.If u r a song and bass lover u shud go ahead and buy these while if your need is frequent calling i would not advice u to purchase these.  Overall not soo satisfied just becz of the mic quality 😔😔"
"The left airdope is not working,returning it and never buying it again.Apart from the defect1) It gets disconnected quickly,and have to keep reconnecting several times.2) Does not fit well in the ear,you'll have to insert it deep inside your ears ,which will start aching within 5 mins of use.3) No noise cancellation at all during calls and audio.Overall do not waste your money and time on this worthless product.Better get a good  branded earphone with 3x times lesser than this price."
"This was my first purchase of any earbuds and as I already had Boat headphones I thought I should go for Boat earbuds too as it is trusted. Honestly, I loved it the battery life is great in moderate use you can use it for days with the case fully charged. Overall a good experience."
Boat products are World class. My experience with Boat products is mind blowing. On technical grounds SQ / NC / BQ & design are unbeatable.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The sound quality is great. Listen to the beat with clarity. Keep them in-ear for a longer duration with comfort. Both water and sweat resistant. The monopod feature is available.Full charging takes 1.5 hrs. Must buy if you are looking for a budget under Rs. 2000 and reliable product."
"I would not recommend this product. when  you want to use it, one earbud invariably doesn't work even when fully charged and it needs to put back in the charging case and removed again. Sound quality is average. Not worth the cost."
Really like the sound quality and the connection range. Also tested the waterproof skill. Really love the product. Noise cancellation at it's next level. Please wear one side while walking on the road. Or I'll suggest do not wear those on the road
"Battery quality drastically reduces after a month of use. And at the end of 2 months, the earbuds started discharging completely within 10 minutes of use. Disappointed with BOAT.Felt no issue with the audio quality. Just the battery durability after 2 months, and charging case were poor quality."
"Some time , actually quite frequently, a irritating  continues buzz sounds keep comingTye sound and balance is terrific. Battery life is good. Good by looks and design. Comfortable enough. And overall best at this price of rs. 1800"
Smartly done good quality ear dopes. They connect easily through Bluetooth. Tried with both iPhone and Samsung (android) and they worked well. Played for over 3 hours and they worked well.
Don’t buy this model to save few more bucks it’s going to be a waste anyway. Most common problem is either left or right side stops working on video calls. Range is not as good as the regular neck bands.One star for amazing sound quality. Buy only if listening music is the only purpose.
Amazing product if u hear DJ songs then u will just love it much more than anything and it's quality is too good even though it does not give a premium look it's touch is also amazing u too just take a try in this thing. it is bettr
The buds sound quality is so perfect. They totally took it to a different level for these product. But the battery life of individual buds is differing for both the buds. one of the buds lasts upto 6 hrs while the other one lasts only 4 hrs. This issue has been the only dissappointing factor. It happened to 3 times when i bought this product seperately. Hope it canbe resolved.
I recd. My 441 boat eardope on 22nd Oct 2021 but after using it I observed that the there is battery drainage problem in my left ear bud as when ever i open my case for using airdope everytime red light blinks in my left eardope. I will use 01 day more then I will apply for replacement. Is it drawback of this eaardope ? Now I become very upset because of this.
I like its compact size. Great sound quality with great bass. Only one small problem is thier and that is battery backup... Without box in one charge it gives me almost 4 to 5 hrs. And with box almost for 4 days. Everything is great calling is also good. But for gamers this is not for you.
"At this price range product is quite good, not the best and it's obvious according the price.Stereo sound quality is not that good according to the price. The  stereo sound will be better if you get used to it slowly.Touch surface is responsive.Battery will run well over the time.Love the Type C charging Port. No need to carry extra charger for charging this airdopes.Build quality is quite good."
"Good investment for the price. But sounds break sometimes one ear at a time and that could get frustrating. And for phone calls, it is pretty bad... I would rather invest more and get better noise cancelling headphones if I need better phone and sound clarity.All in all, for the price, it is decent. I bought it at 2k during discounts. Never buy at cost price of 5k"
"Amazing product and sound is too good . Bass quality is excellent, when you put into your both ear ,it's attached like a clip that's very important because your ear doesn't damage and charging quality is not excellent but too good because after listening 3to 4 song charge remains go down 100%to 70%,but good battery. At last product is very good and nice colour, thank you...."
Sound Quality is Best under BudgetNoise Cancellation is OhkBass Quality is 1st classJust Go for it....Everyone Talk about that bass is too much but you need to do just one thing go to equalizer and reduce bass increases treble and Vocals &Done ✔ 👌Apart from this sound quality is best
"The sound is perfect and good enough for ears and specially who is bass lover they will definitely love this product ... The jbl giving same product in 6k, obviously he is huge brand and one of the best companies for sound high price is obvious but if someone have less budget than nothing is better than this bcz boat giving asm sound quality in less price so don't think much and buy it.."
"It worked fine for 1st 6 months...Then the battery issue started...On 10 month, the battery drains in 5 mins.....No service centre to complaint to...Bottomline...... Highly disappointed."
as return window is closed i cant even return now will have to go service center. i am disappointed. i will never ever recommand this brand to anyone. such an embracement when you gift this product and it stops working after a week. thank you boat..
The headsets were overall very good and better than I expected but it had some problems like the headsets would heat up after a bit of time in the case occasionally.and the mic is not the best but it is pretty good but overall it’s a very good headset and I love using it!
Bhai koi bhi order mat karna. Mene order kya tha but aaya bahut ghatiya quality tha or one side ka not working tha. Fir mene replesment krwa diya but unhone replacement nahi kiya.  Isliye agar kisi ko bhi earpod chahiye to wo apne kisi mobile market me jakar sahi se check karke le lena.... 😔😔😟
"10 days since using the airdrops...Good sound clarity and bass... Dropped twice and nothing happened.... No noise cancellation at all ... Good for music and not so good for calls .... Even a small sounds from far (like other talking , Tv,) also not getting cancelled and giving problem to other person on phone"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Product touch is too poor, Sound quality is poor, coordination problem in both buds.. Product not upto expectationsReceived Replacement that also having problem. Also it seems used product. Disappointed, Not Expected"
The audio quality of the boAt Airdopes 441 Pro TWS Ear-Buds is amazingIf you are a bass lover and loves to listen to such kind of music where the bass is everythingWhat a quality product 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥...Boat airdopes 441 antee flower anukunvaa fireuuu 🔥🔥🔥🔥 ....😮🥵🔥🔥😱😱😱

 When I connect With my Iphone Automatic Disconnected & While Receive Any Call Then Auto Disconnect, Now Not Working Proper way sometime 1 EarPod Working So 1 EarPods not working also today i tried for connect with my phone not connected with EarPods, 1 EarPods working 1 EarPods dead."
1. Sound quality is very poor.2. No noise cancelation.3. Continuous changing required.4. If you are using mono mode battery drained drastically.5. Battery box quality is very poor.NO FOR GAMERNO FOR MUSIC LOVERNO FOR NORMAL CALLING
"First of all product quality is good and even the sound quality is good (especially for the bass lovers)…I never had ear buds before but after using them I realized that they are good enough for daily life…however noise cancellation is the major issue, I mean even though you are at any public place or home, othe side person hears all the surrounding sound which is not good."
One month usage review: 1. Amazing sound quality2. Fast charging3. More authenticity4. Fits perfectly in ear. Suitable for workout freaks.5. Value for money6. Better than airpods (sorry apple fans. But I also own airpods and I found this one much better)
"I honestly think this is such a good BT earbud. It charges real quick and stays in use for a long time. I use it during workouts and is perfect, without any hassle in regards to the grip in the ear & being swear resistant. Go for it. It's perfect. I got the limited edition masaba collection - black star. The box looks so cute."
The no return policy speaks the cheating aspects in it. Product is too hyped . Worth only to the extend of price of Rs 1500/.Can't be considered as substitute of expensive ones.
I have purchase boat 441 date -30-06-2019After one month one side airdopes is not working and blink pink light .after that  I am continue calling the customer care numberBut Number is not working I Have send mail regarding this matter but one mail I’d is not valid which is mention on warranty cardI am fail to understand .what can I do .I am totally disappointed .its to expensiveAnd very poor service of customer care.
i purchased this on 3nov and started facing technical issues from april 7 when i guess warranty period was still there... its just wasting of your valuable money... not worth for 2000 atleast.. pls dnt buy i dont recommend it AT ALL...
"Worth every penny at this budget. Being a non-intensive user, this dopes served me full day on single charge for about 15 calls of 5 mins on average, and 2–2.5 hrs of music and social media."
"The colour, fit and quality of the ear pods are good, but the Bluetooth range is mot great. The left ear pod gets disconnected too often even when I’m holding the connected phone in my hand.But it could also be a problem with my iPhone. Not sure."
"Extremely poor mic quality, on a call there is some noices and breaking my voice. I have tested in multiple phone. But one thing I have say it has very good sound quality and bass. But really not good for calling purpose"
If u bass lover go blindBuild quality perfectSound perfectBass i cnt explain dont spoil ur money on costly tws this tws is exllent all overBass is unbelievable superdupeFitting also perfect small ear user  also can enjoyThis tws in this price is realy good deal
They sit on the ear comfortably. Have amazing sound quality. The battery life is as much as they claim. Though I sometimes had difficulty with the connection which was I couldn't hear anything if my phone is on a higher place but otherwise they're good
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 1) After 1 hour of using the ear starts hurting.2) While gaming at 100% the sound feels like 30-40%.3) As you can see in the video the product has been tampered manually. Looks like it has been glued for some reason.4) I wanted a refund but that wasn't provided also.For a company like Amazon this is really the worst experience in online shopping. This i never expected for a huge company like this"
There r cheaper products also available...bt they don't look so good in ear. It fits well n looks good.n features are also good...good designe good sound and good battery.
The headphones is awesome have been using since a month now and works fine. Battery life is also good. But only problem is of the sensors can't use while traveling as it gets switched off due a small touch.
It started heating and my ear started paining...I just took off immediately. I need refund.. Horrible experience.
"I had to replace the first set because of some noise in left ear bud. After the replacement this new set is working good. Satisfied with my purchase at this low price. You can go for it,if you are a wireless type person rather than wired one."
Boat Airdopes 441 pro good productSound quality is goodBattery life of case is goodIP x7 rating waterproof earbudsOverall best under 2500...
Worst and cheap product...it has stopped working afte 1 week wheb the return window has closed...never expected this kind of product from amazon website...one should never buy from amazon...boat producta are cheap...they are just fooling customers
This is what i wantVery good connectivityGood battery backupI think this is best in its class & on its price pointGo for it with out any tension
It is china product not up to the markMost importantly amazon shall write on product image origin of made in.Why not put made in P.R.C than I would not prefer to buy.
"post 2 days of usage1Pros:1. Decent Bass, best in this price segment(purchased at 2k inr)2. Passive noise cancellation-impressive3. Capacitive Touch Control feature is impressive, works as on paper.4. Strong battery life.5. Perfectly fits in ear.Cons1. Ear aches after 1hr of continuous usage, I guess with all the other earbuds this is the case."
Nice tws under 2.5kbest call qualityBattery capacity also gudBuilt quality okFit in ear tightly not fear to fall but sum time later ear will be feels pain
Its the best in the term of sound but after a week the airdopes start to get disconnected on their own nd unpaired from the other earbud nd this issue i have faced from 2-3times in 3weeks of use ...the charhing is also good just sometimes when the buds are placed in the case it doesn't start to charge i have to remove nd placed it back again for around 2-3times then it starts to charge
I was not looking to spend a lot on wireless earbuds. This was a perfect choice and am glad I chose this. The sound quality is pretty good. The pro version having a bigger backup battery is a blessing.
Do not buy this product because it is automatically connect and disconnect with  mobile when I sit in the train I found that it automatically connect and disconnect with mobile and now these continue everyday with me
Fantastic earbuds at affordable price. I would suggest my fellow buyers to go for the Airdopes pro version as it also provides a awesome charging case which not only charges the Earbuds but also acts as a powerbank and can be used to charge your smartphone.(These earbuds doesn't support on keypad mobile handset)
"When I got the earbud I was so excited but after I opened the box I was completely taken aback. How many times I try, it won't pair with my phone. Plus the right earbud was unresponsive. Even the blue green alternating led was also not glowing in the left on properly. Factory reset did not help. I am so disappointed with this product. I am afraid I have wasted my money."
Ok so...my first impressions are..Thebsound quality is really great...justifies the price very much....the quality of the materials used is also very good...and fits in ears very well..it may be not comfortable for few people... battery back up is also good..I would suggest you to buy these airdopes and it's definitely worth the money which is ₹1.4k when I bought.
"The battery life and fit are really good, one can't expect complete noise cancellation but would do the work. Though the fit is good it'd start hurting after few hours, touch controls can be improved.Keeps disconnecting few times while playing music."
Careful on thesePoor performanceNo bass baseTreble is moreUnfit to earNo loudnessTrapProduct comes with no refund policyOnce you buy you can't returnI lost my money
"First day use review... good product, excellent bass...lightning fast bluetooth connectivity.....little disappointed with the treble....overall good buy"
"Very nice in quality, light weight, comfortable in ears, sound quality is outstanding, sweat as well as waterproof is also very good, good battery pack up, distance while using or calling away from phone is also incredible,love this product very much........"
"Overall it is a good product but it is a bit heavy for the ears, if you wear it for more than 2 hours your ears will start to ache a bit and the major problem is that earbuds lost connectivity during the calls for milliseconds, it reconnects itself, I don't know is this problem is only with my product or overall issue, I bought on 13 Oct-21 and returning on 20th Oct-21"
"That's a good product. If there is a budget issue then one must tey these tws.Sound Quality and Bass Quality both are actually very good, but noice cancellation is little poor. And the calling experience is not good. The caller can listen all the surrounding sound which is a drawback for these tws. If the purpose is just to enjoy music then these are really good."
In love with this airdopes.Perfect fit and good sound quality. Easy to install. Overall everything is perfect. But those who used airpods they may not like airdopes.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Amazon sucks!!!! No option to return this only get replacement even when the product performance is pathetic. Complete waste of money, just received and one of the earbuds not working plus missing charging cable, earmuffs."
"This is good for the price range.I could wear helmet with the pods in ear.Only downside I see, little pain in the ear whe we use it for more than two hours"
"Sound quality is awesome, nice bass and treble good earphone for watching movies and listing to songs.... about 3 hrs of battery backup i experienced in single charge and with battery case about 17-18 hrs battery backup i get.. overall good experience with earbuds"
"The boat airdopes 441 are quite good with respect to build quality and quick connectivity. However, sometimes the mic quality is not that great and the person with whom you are talking on the other side of call fails to hear what you are telling. Moreover, when it's windy and you want to talk using these airdopes, it's an utter failure. The noise cancellation is not that great. The charge cycle and power back-up are fair. It's decent for the price that you pay."
while talking in phone when no one at surround it is best if noice is there then it is catching noice and deliver to the caller.While driving on bike without helmet its catching wind noice delivering that to caller.Listening music is good and ear tips also in very smooth for long stay.
"I order boat 441 , left earbud of it making static noise so that I replace order and strange is what replace earbuds also making same noise and which is most disturbing. sound quality is so good but I can't avoid that noise so I am returning those earbuds."
"For Mild Use The charge goes on for 2-3 weeks.. I Like it mostly because of this reason only.. not good for voice calling...look for other pods if you want to make regular calls... Sound Quality is above average at best.. Don't wear both when jogging on road, I take just one ear with me..."
"I used to have same boat 441 earpod before from boat outlet directly  and it was fantastic but this time when I ordered from Amazon they deliver me damaged and defective peice of boat 441 which disconnect in every 10 mins and battery does down in 5 minutes, I don't know how to give them back to reorder proper earpod 441. Please help with new earpod or return my money."
The AirPods have barely been used sparingly for a month and it has stopped charging completely. The unfortunate part is that it was a gift and I recently received this feedback. Very disappointed with this product and hoping the team can help provide a replacement if possible? Looking forward to hearing back.
OVERALL ITS VERY GOOD PRODUCTSPECIALLY INSTANT WAKE AND PAIR COMES IN HANDY EVERY TIME ON THE GOCALLING IS OK NOT SO DOODNO LOW LATENCY MODE SO NOT SUITABLE FOR GAMING BUT MUSIC EXPERIENCE IS VERY GOODWORTH BUYING
"The ear plugs never seem to charge to their full capacity. The touch controls stop working intermittently too.Unfortunately, I can't return the product anymore. Very disappointed with the product. Not recommended."
"Not good for calls , only for music.During calls voice is too much lagAlso buds are not getting disconnected from phone while kept in charging case, I have to turnoff my phone's Bluetooth"
It's not even been complete two months and the right earbud has stopped working completely. Over and above that the customer care is pathetic. They are not responding to my emails. I had raised a warranty claim vide request number 1401030.
"Sound is good. Bass is average. Weight is a bit heavy, ears start paining when using for long time.Highly do not recommend if you are buying for the purpose of calling or attending meetings because have to speak loud then only my voice reaches the other person.  I bought for the purpose of attending meetings & sadly can't return because there is no option to return 😢"
"After seeing so many reviews, I bought this. Within 15 min of wearing ears are paining."
"Airdopes are really quite good!It takes time to get used to this if u aren't a buds user....Sound quality is good!Gaming latency isn't upto mark!Like u may have latency at times!But if it's for other uses like movies,phone calls,etc it's excellent!But I recommend to go for airdopes 441 pro....it has a better battery backup and design is also cool!"
All are just talks it can't even last 2 hours and here they talk about 5 hrs backup.Ain't satisfied with battery performance nor with range. Distance connection is only possible if linearity is maintained. Walls intercepts the connection due to which sounds can't be heard clearly. Bass is too high.😔Just after a week or twoBattery is worst buds doesn't even work for 1 hour it get charged pretty fast and battery drainage is fast too.
Only first day calling work i use Vivo v21e which is 27000 phone and use different earbuds also(bluetooth one ) that all works wellI think this product have esshue with mic and calling
Amazing product . Best buy at 1999 rupees .Best sound quality and bass is superb.You can use it at running time . This will be not fall.I'm preparation for army physical so i buy it for get some motivation. And real sound as like theater.
Perfect earphones for workout.. bass is good! Battery life can be something which worries.. light weighed.. easily fits in your ears and no chance that airdopes can fall down.. build structure is quite good.Sound quality is above average.. you may not be able to recognise every instrument while listening music
This item is too irritating. It Don't connect and Disconnect smoothly. Sometimes it Disconnect Automatically.if you wish to waste your money then go for it. Other wise dont. Problem with Phone and computer and Laptop also. connectivity issue is major with this product. I genuinely suggest not to buy it
I bought this recently.. I would say it's sound quality and bass quality is above the par!. I have been using during my gym workouts and jogging sessions. It suits my ear perfectly and have never fell down once..but it doesn't have good noise cancellation. I would give these ratingsBass quality : 4.5/5Sound quality : 4/5Fit : 5/5Charge : 4/5Noise cancellation : 3/5
"I bought boat wireless Earbuds from Amazon, and it was delivered on June 18, 2021, only a month it worked properly, now after charging, earbuds are in red light. Really disappointed with its quality. Please don't Buy. However, amazon customer support helped me in getting their contact. Boat customer support is the worst, and you won't get a response."
"See that red plastic on the curve... That F**g hurt my ears. I would not recommend any of the airpods as they r not comfortable to wear.(i have used Noise, Mivi and bout) Better buy a neckband earphones. I swear don't waste money on airpods."
"Worked fine for 15 days, after that microphone stoped working can play only music, no calling....China item chala to chand tak nahito sham tak😂😂"
Sound Quality is ok. But the earpods are always in connected mode even though we close the box. Didn't feel it good about it. My charging got drained at frequently.
"Review after 15days of usage.. hopeless product. Left-side airdope is not working. It's taking the charge, if I click on the airdope it's responding pause the music vor play the music. But no sound. Not so comfortable even with the fitting into ears. I am not happy with the product. Wonder how the avg Rating is so high.."
I am disappointed with Amazon i ordered it three times each time I get is not good product first time right side ear buds is not charging in second time right side ear buds is not producing sound company claim after each charge you will get 5 hr play back but I get only 1 and half hour I am very very disappointed with Amazon and boat.

 Airdope is good but I observed after using month right airdope get early discharge.. battery backup is good with case only otherwise max back-up with left airdop is 2hour and right airdope give 1.5hour active time"
The sounds quality is good. Bass is excellent and the power bank option for the case is extraordinary but the noice cancellation is very very poor. Cannot talk on phone while outside and I don't see a point in using these airdopes inside home. If noice cancellation update is done and a firmware update is given then this will be an excellent product.
"Sound quality is good, but not good at all for longer usage. If you use 30 mins to 1 hour you will feel discomfort in your ears. Not the best of sensors. Noise cancellation in calls outdoor is worst and in indoors it echos. Overall not a worthy product. FYI Amazon just replaces the product no return for this"
"Product sound is very good, fitting is good, I ordered red colour. Every Thing cool. Only one defect. The sensor is not working once we doing first touch while using after taking from set. We need to do lon press for google assistant then the other sensor like pause, play, next song, previous songs working."
"I received the first airdopes and the issue with it was left earbuds would stop working in few minutes. Next while connecting on zoom meeting the sound would suddenly drop or stop completely. Then I asked for replacement, now come the fun part, they send the replacement with an empty box no airdopes at all."
So the other day I used it and it actually fell inside a bucket of water ...then I removed it and dried ...it still works well and the exact same way it did on the first day ...psych product
Product have humming/scratching sound in left headphone which irritate during use. It was birthday gift to my dear ones but he use only 2 times in one month due to this issue.
This is a long term review. Really impressed with the quality. Be it wireless or wired earphone they never last for 3 to 5 months when I use them but this buds are really dope. I ordered it on 2020 October and till date these earphones are going strong. The rubber protection really does its job of protecting the earphone from the fall. Great product superb quality.
The sound quality is absolutely fantastic. No problems while answering a call. Bass is superb! Only issue - I'm getting white static noise when I'm connected to the mobile and not playing any music. It's very irritating to listen to the static noise when the earphones are idle... Might have received a defective piece. Ordered a return for the product. Awaiting the new piece to arrive.
Very fast service which I was not expecting..very nice product but still u will feel noise while talking with someone sound is very less bass is not that much but good..ok product at this price.. thanks to Amazon for good service ..
"Good product with reasonable bassBattery backup as declaredGood choice if chosen generally, to meet budget standards."
"The fit is perfect. Doesnt shake when riding, running, driving. Fits comfortably without any irritation. Sound quality is superb. Water resistance in heavy rains is awesome. Touch control is perfect but it doesn't work well when you are sleeping on sides as it gets turned off and on frequently due to pressure of pillow."
"Simply awesome , it's sound quality and high bass is excellent . And remember if you're going outside then use only one earbud because this airdopes noise cancellation is very high, so you can't hear what's going on outside . If you want listen songs in peace without any disturbance then just go ahead . It is a good product for music lovers🎶"
"Only in low volume feels good, if anybody like me feels high volume not preferable. No clear audio in high volume. Battery life awesome. Fixing in year firmly. Snugs into the position. Even in bike ride also no slipping. Material quality also good. Touch control is extra feature makes it use easy. Over all user friendly. If sound quality good this one is a awesome product"
"They are really durable, for ex: one of the airpodes fell off from my terrace to ground floor by mistake, but nothing happened to it. Although they are bit uncomfortable if you are in teenage, they might not fit in your ears. But, once they fit inside, they won't come out easily while running or exercising.Sometimes, they automatically disconnect from phone and you've to reconnect them, that's the only issue I am facing using them."
The earphones are good enough at this price point.. One can definitely go for these as a mid-range wireless earphones... Connectivity is also quite fast.. 3-5 sec is enough for the earphones to get connected with your device.. Bass is very impressive.. Sound quality is also fine.. Noise canceling is also very good.. I will definitely recommend it as a budget earphones.
"This is my first pair of wireless earbuds, I use them mostly for calls with my laptop and phone and they are very good for that purpose. Music quality though is not really great, bass is to forced and sound is a little... I'm not sure about the word to use, muffled? Or dampened? In either case I won't recommend them for music lovers."
Best quality.  I bought it 6 month ago. Very easy to use. Worth the money.
"Giving this review after 10 days of use•Music is good and bass is awesome•connectivity is great•Calls are ok,the call quality is average,indoor in a quite environment the call quality is good,noise cancellation is not that good but you can manage•Battery life is awesome just as per the mentioned details•Fit is great you can do workouts with these in your ears without much worry that they will fall off"
"The product worked well for a year. Bass is very obviously boosted. Works for certain types of music..After a year and a half, it seems like one of the drivers has conked off. The response is now very bad..Not happy with the life of the ear phones."

 One bud stopped working in a month's time.Previously I had bought Boat Bluetooth Headset, that also stopped working in 3 months use. This time I took a chance with ear buds and again same experience. It seems Boat Brand is not durable. Do not ever buy any product of this brand."
"Super kool. Must buy. I was first a bit hesitant, but after getting it, was very happy. Doesn't fall, nice sound, bass could've been better."
Sound quality is ok ok. Noise cancellation is not upto the mark. Per charge each ear bud last max 2 and half hours. At this price range meets only the basic needs. I have not calculated the case charging hours but it is somewhat satisfactory.Drawback : not easily fit to small ear holes. And once inserted in ear it feels somewhat airtight.
I've used boat headset before. It was great . But this product does not meet up the expectations. Also one side of the eardope stopping working in less than couple of months.
After 2 weeks of use ... Sound quality is briliant ..bass is also good ... Battery backup is good it's give 3 or 3.5 hrs ... But problem is that if you used this more than 1hrs it's like uncomfortable you the earbuds fiting rubber are uncomfortabled you your ear are paining ... But sound quality or bass is loves you go for it ☺️
"Guys bought this  with the intention  of playing pubg but disappointed because sound lag.So hard to connect sometimes doesn't connect and Have to switch off and on each earbuds or outback into charger case, I'm not recommending this but it's sound quality and bass is excellent not comfortable infitting into ears..."

 I personally don't like this airdopes because after 2,3 months I started having problem like only one airdopes is working and I can't wear them for long time because my ear hurts, and battery life is also not too good. I don't usually write reviews but I'm writing because I don't want you to make same mistake that I did"
"The product stopped working from day two, firstly wrong product delivered and later replaced with correct product and its not working from second use. Amazon wont help and ask to contact brand waste of time and money . Completely disappointed with the product and service from amazon , i feel not to order any electronics on amazon here on, with this kind of service"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Worst app, never use amazon they only scam people with worst quality products, this was the gift I got for my dad and see what i got in return, never buy anything on amazon worst app ever"
if u buy boat product dont expect u will get aftersale service it will be waste of ur time if ur paying that much amount of money u expect good aftersale service but there is none so ur ok with worst aftersale service then buy product otherwise dont waste ur money they dont care about customers i m not buying any boat product in my life ever again
Pros : excellent sound quality. Bass quality is great and have good depth. Noice cancellation is good. Touch sensitivity is good but felt a little inconvenience with some operations like enabling voice command. Super compatible and fits nicely .Cons : you should handle it with care. Not that easy to grab from the case. Battery life is weak. I would say it will last up to 3 or may b 4 hrs.
"I ordered these in October sales. Excited because it is cheap and has good reviews..received it,I got a faulty product,the ear phones were making some weird noise,I applied for a replacement,recieved the replacement and that too turned out to be a faulty one,the left earphone made more sound than the right one....I didnt apply for a refund because I was waiting for these for a long time...please check your product thoroughly"
"Other than the near to no noise cancelling feature this headphone is a good purchase for me. It has good quality bass, good volume. Connectivity is seamless & hassle-free once it is paired to your phone."
The left earpod does not work.plus the sound quality is not proper theres so noise coming while playinh songs.plus there is no policy for return of money so u just have to use it without being satisfied with it....highlyy disappointed seriouslyy
"Having been using this product since last 6 months, one thing I can say is that Boat did not live upto the expectations. The battery on the right tws just starting to die within 30 mins while the left bud keeps on going for 3+ hours. Even the wired earphones last me longer than these so called convenient true wireless earphones.Wouldn't recommend to anyone."
"Sound is good, power bank option is good, but the device what i got Right side airdope not working properly ..And no volume control function in device.. That's why I returned the product thanks to Amazon customer service i got my refund with in 3 hours of returning product.. Don't why boat still have 6mm driver size as realme introduced 13.5mm driver in their device"
Im writing  4 month using review!!!!It's working awesome no major issues yet..And I buy it for 2kRly it's satisfied My expectionsVery good product from Boat.
Worst delivery by Amazon... it took 7and a half day to reach me !! Even after having prime membership for the whole year..!! Worst experience of delivery.  🙏🏻But the product is awesome ♥️
"I have using for a week as of now. I must say, it stays in ear well. So those who are gym goers, or the one using while walking, this is definitely a good product.Fair sound for the amount you pay and cancels noise to such a good extent.Economical | worth it"
I don’t have any problems in this airdrop boat made it perfect1. Trouble is nice2. Bass is hole another levelOverall it’s too goodI am writing this review after 1 and half year of use and nothing change in sound quality it’s like new evey dayJust close your eyes and buy itBelieve it you will not regret after buying this product
Quality of product and performance is awesome.But difficult to understand the LED indications. Too many combinations with 3 coloured LED.
Overall a good pair of headphones!! sounds really good and has good connectivity!!but my headphone case does not charge my phone. It gets disconnected too often.BOAT should look into this matter.
"The noise cancellation is not effective, the mic volume is very low so the person on the other side can barely hear me.Not worth it if using for work purposes ... I just use it now to hear music and I brought it just a week or 10 days back"
On call voice quality is very poor. Other side of the call cannot listen to my words clearly most of the time. Not at all good for making calls.It is very painful to keep it in the ear for even 1 hour. I removed the fins and it pains even after that. Trust me. It is a genuin review.
"Bad quality don't buy from cloudtail India wrost seller of Amazon, no customer support and bad sound every time bad noise in ear and pain also"
Great for running and working out. Some are having a problem with one earphone not working...it happened to me too...just pop them back in the case and it should work normally.
sound quality is too good when listing music.But when you are talking to a person then repeated it's disconnecting automatically.so i think the connectivity issue needs to be resolved.
"Most rated TWS earbuds and it lived up to the expectations..No issues in Pairing and connectivity, battery life and charging is up to the mark easily lasts a day,Sound quality is super good but bass heavy so naturally dominates trebleCall quality is good but noise cancellation is just average as learnt from callers they had disturbances when talking from outside like wind and traffic soundsOverall more than satisfied.. Impressive music experience and good battery life as of now."
"The reason I have given a 1 star for everything is that since i recieved and opened up the box, the right ear pod didn’t power up or connect or charge. There is no quality control. Now I will be wasting another day for return and yet another 3-5 days in order to be refunded and be able to order a new pair of earphones which will definitely not be boat."
"Useless product, don't fall into marketing traps of these useless products. Battery backup is 30 minutes only.  My airpodes are waiting for warranty replacement since I bought them. it's been more then a month now."
"Before i use 441,and i liked that most thats why i order 2 of them... Now i saw its a same upgrade model so i brought.. One.. Everything is good but compair to 441 , 441 pro battery finish so fast, Hearing sound rate also little slower...Overall If someone buy fst tym... For sure he loved it.. Very nice product"
"It's been quite some time using these, I have seen quite few issues not major but quite irritating some some times, i really like the long battery life which is a huge plus point, quality of the sound is good, noise cancellation is fine but not good, bass quality is good, overall the product best in this price range."
"I got this order on the expected date (3 November 2021), fully charged it, and I've been using it since then with it's power bank for at least 12hours each day for the past 2 weeks now with one bar left in the power. I use one airdopes at a time, so as not to run out completely. I'm really enjoying it and hope to purchase more for family and friends."
This device is having more connectivity problems. After full charge also on the call voice gets disconnect very frequently. Bluetooth frequency also very less. It is hardly working from 6 meter distance. I am not happy with this product. I want to return it and need my money back. After return second time I received it but problem is still same.
"This works fine. Range is ok, battery backup is good. There is one problem though when playing news, movie etc. there is buzzing noise in the left earpiece continuously. This doesn't happen when playing songs or during phone calls. I got it replaced thinking that it's defective but the replacement also had the same problem. I think this problem might be with design or manufacturing."
"I ordered it because of its popularity but it seems I was wrong. I had to replaced it coz left earned was not working and now the replaced one has charging issues, it's taking all the time in the world to get fully charged whereas company claimed it be fully charged in 1.5. If you are planning to buy this keep your fingers crossed to get the issue less product."
Good quality and battery backup. But it keeps falling off my ear at times so it's annoying. Ppl who think this won't stay in ur ears go for a one with support.
बैटरी बैकअप भी उतना ज्यादा नहीं है और सुस्ती सी मोबाइल से कनेक्ट करने पर या दूर जाने पर पर डिस्कनेक्ट हुआ था 7 दिन से जब मैं अभी ब्लूटूथ से मोबाइल से कनेक्ट कर रहा हूं तो यह वॉइस क्वालिटी आ ही नहीं रहा है जो कि जब लेकिन जब मीडिया से कनेक्ट कर रहा हूं तो बाकी सब और साउंड क्वॉलिटी वीडियो क्वॉलिटी आ रहा है लेकिन वॉइस का ही नहीं रहा है बहुत ही बहुत ही निम्न क्वालिटी है इसका लेना ही बहुत पछतावा होगा
Sound quality is good.. battery backup is also good.. likes the design but when it comes to fitting it's too fit to ears and u will not be able to hear anything from outside as it will block your ears totally...for me i wanted a ear bud which I can wear and also can hear something if something is happening arround me...and also notice cancellation is not good at all
"Best in the class, sound, bass and treble. Superb built quality, responsive and amazing battery backup."
"when compared to other such products on Amazon, this is very expensive.  Similar quality on different brands are available on Amazon for half the price"
"I bought this product on december 21 2020,Initial quality was good but not as i expected however after a month I started facing challange such as there's a noice in the buds when you connect it with your phone, mic of buds do not work often times . If one wants to buy the buds to use for only few days then go for it but in long run these buds would not be tye right choice."
"According to the price its something that won't disappoint you comparing with other. Sound quality is really nice ..I am quite impressed with the bass quality considering the price range, also build quality is really nice and it's really comfortable to use. I would not say it's something extraordinary but........if your budget is low and you want something satisfying..this is your kick."
"I purchased airdops 441 pro recently and first day of experience is very bad, within 2 hours I returned.Sound quality of earbuds is good but when it comes to call quality and connectivity its pathetic.in between call right earbud disconnecting.  and after my first skype call from laptop its not connecting with my laptop and in phone call sound also very bad."
The Sound On These Airdopes are Literally Dope as the Name Suggests. The Bass is Super Loud while also keeping a Good Check on the Treble side. Microphone works fine.The Only Drawback i find are the Touch pads are super responsive and you cannot Enjoy music or Take Calls While lying Down wearing these as even if the touch pads are touched by the Pillows the Call Disconnects/Music stops.
Doesn't work with windows laptop. Mic quality is poor. Other person always complains about background noise and poor voice.Good for listening music with mobile.Not suitable for calling.
The disadvantage is that even if your hand touches the earbud touch by mistakenly during a call it gets disconnected. Light flashing cant be turned off..
"Sound quality, bass, noise cancellation is great.Audio and mic quality indoor works great but will face some problem outdoor.Build material is good and CTC works a little bit slow but it is very sensitive.Lights and Colour look very attractive.Overall, if this is going to be your first TWS then you should go for it, you won't regret."
"Been using this product for last 3 days. Can't say much about battery life as I'm not a continuos user. But the sound quality is superb. Previously I was realme buds wireless, and compared to that the bass is overwhelming. Mids and lows r also perfectly matched. Sturdy fit adds to its looks. Got it at discounted price of 1799, and at this price it's unmatched."
Sound quality is goodBattery life is 3hrsGood fit for earsTouch sensitivity in buds is good.Not recommended for long time usage (slight irritation in ear).
Used it since the time i received it and it's just awesome...wireless great vibrant colors and good sound quality does not hurt your ears with the sound...
Amazing. Better than what I expected. V good sound quality. Love the experience of listening music in my Airdopes.
If you want bass and low latency gaming from a tws this is not you are looking for its just for those who like non bassy sound and dont play online games at allIn case your budget is low and you want both low latency gaming and heavy bassy sound go for some earphone bets would be House of marley earphones they cost 900 and they are sturdy enough for rough use and also latecy and bass wont be a issue ever
"I have received this product today, before this product I have used snokor by infinix earbuds, sound quality vice this one is good and battery backup vice snokor was..I have return this buds because while I play something noise is coming from left side bud, a radio like sound coming from it..Sound quality-4/5Bulid-3. 5/5Looks 4.5/5Battery backup-3/5Not worthy in 2500+ price"
"Awesome battery backup, a very good fit in ears, average bass quality but the sound got distorted as we increase the volume from 70%  and it become a headache at 100% because of the complete distorted sound.Gestures are really good to play/pause, pick/discard a call, shifting songs but there should be volume gesture which is missing that make it a good buy"

 I'm very happy with this ear buds. I'm using first time in my life ...so my experience is very highly satisfied,Thanks BOAT TEAMRegards,Sidhant"
"Overall the product is decent. Since I ordered this for video and audio conferences/calls, the experience has been very poor. There are massive disturbance (mic) complaints, from the other side, when on call. Would have preferred returning the product, but I missed the return date deadline by a day...."
"I am boat airdopes 441 user.I have some problem of low sound in🦻🦻 my airdopes right ear last month.I claim for warranty and replaced it.""'But still now after some time new airdopes is have same problem.😥😥'""When I sent email about our problem they did not gave any answer of my problem😡😡Those customer care service is very bad 👎😠😤"
The product has really disappointing. It has high latency period. It takes a long pause before u actually listen to voice. Miscommunication! At this price the company should have taken care of issue. Didn’t expect such a bad performance. Please don’t buy this product as it is going to be a big disappointment for u!
"The product does a good job in holding in your ear, does not fall when running. Does not have volume +/- but the sound is good enough to enjoy. However the challenge comes when I try talking over these bluetooth speakers, person on other side can not hear me and I always have to disconnect bluetooth and go for regular phone. No I dont use them at all."
"Very elegant look, High sound quality with amazing  stereo and bass effect. Was able to feel great surround effect with 8D music in youtube. Really worth the value for money."
Just Telling My Friends And After Checking the Order Date I Remembered I'm using this for 20 Months.The sound and Bass quality is best.Fitting is also good. I use this when I go to the gym and no problems at all.
I wouldn't suggest anyone to buy this earpods.It's not worth it because of following reasons1) huge lag in gaming experience (pubg)2) Bluetooth issues( dosent connect automatically sometimes)3)Major issues with call connect (no communication when connected)4) Battery discharge quickly5)Audio drops sometimes when listening to music
"Very bad quality of this product,, sound issue always and basse issue alwys battery backup is also very bad quality ,,,,,,very pathetic product,i dont want to keep this product i want to refund my money collect your product and refund my full amount in my account asap and all this formality should in one day not more than that😡,very bad and poor experience with boat"
"It was working fine fir 2-3 months , them problem started . Even in warranty period they take more than ine month to gice yor resolution, they picked my faulty product 1 month back and now aaking for another 8-10 days to despatch my product back."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Best TWS in the market in this price range."
It's connected automatically after one time paired to Bluetooth and put it on inside charging port it's automatically disconnected from Bluetooth so i like this feature

 Amazing package, Wonderful design, best for music lovers, sound and bass quality is good"
This was my first time buying earpods I felt it will fall from ear but no these pair is just perfectIt fits goodThank you for the rubber grill its fits perfect without painThe battery output is just long lasting I never thought it would last so longAnd thanks for the magnetic caseIt looks cool and handyIts not too big perfectly fits in pocket
"No complaints about the music quality. It is indeed a good earphone which not only is affordable but also provides one of the best sound quality among the various earphones present in this price range.I had some issues with the airpods, though through good after-sale service that boAt offers, it was easily replaced."
"Worst condition in driving n talking,  even in normal calling another person complaining your voice not coming clearly.  I m faceup I lost my money in this boat 441 product wort again I said don't by pls . Or u will loss ue money.  Go for something good product.  Or go online shopping best way to buy gadgets.  Thx"
"One ear pod is not working even after trying all the instructions given in manual and worst part is that there is no service center in Bangalore for boat , really frustrated with this product and literally not going to recommend boat products to anyone here after"
"It’s overall an amazing product with an amazing sound quality, easy to use controls and a secure fit. It can be used while playing or exercising without the fear of it falling out of your ears. The battery life is good and the charging super fast. The only downside that I could find about this product is that the fit is a bit too tight and can cause a minor pain in yours ears if worn for a bit too long like 2-3 hours."
"Badhiya hi,Sound quality achi hi3.5 hours chalta hiCharge bhi jaldi to jata hiConnectivity bhi thik hiBass k nam pe kuch nai hi2000 k andar achi chez hi"
"Disappointed. Not connecting properly with laptop and voice calls. Touch is very sensitive that even you rub your ear, the call disconnects. No ease of use."
These earbuds are bomb at such a damn low price. The bass is just so amazing with depth and loudness and the sound quality is superb. Its been almost 2-3 months I've been using them. These earbuds will always give you a reason to listen music everyday.
"Sond quality is good 👍,  base is also good 👍,  disappointing with noice cancellation, Beatty backup upto 3 hours, i am using this product last 1 month all things are good, but battery life is less it works upto 3 hours. If you are spending 2000 rupees on it and it works upto 3 hours or less i think it is a one kind of disappointing factor of this product."
"Nice sounds compared to boat 381 airdopes, feels more comfortable in ear than Airdopes 381. Bass is good. Costs 1949/-"
"Overall quite a nice product for 1799. Quick connect and amazing sound quality!👍👌Good for 1 to 2 days use.Cons: even if you accidentally touch it, it stops playing the content"
"If I touch it by mistake, one of the pods get disconnecting. To repair both again, I neet to keep it in box and pair.. taking time.Ears getting Pain with Shark grippers. With out those it cannot stay in ears.All Ok Sound Quality and Noise Cancellation."
"This fits perfectly in my ear. Music quality is good. Call quality is good as well. But there is no noise cancellation feature. But for the price, is worth the buy"
"Used this for 5days before returningEverything was good until left earbud stopped working on fourth dayTried factory resetting the buds but no helpIt's sound is oswm, battery is what you are promised, not 30hrs but easily 24- 26 hours, around 4.5 hrs to 6 hrs on 100% to 80% battery with dual buds and 2.5hrs with single buds"
"I brought it for the purpose of calls, but the other person can hear anything. It's a waste for calls. And their fit is not good, they keep falling off. Overpriced for such a product. Regret buying! I brought it for 2500, now the price is showing 2000. Why scam people with sub-par products! Go for a better brand ! Don't buy these headphones!"
These are a total waste of money. Thereis no noise cancellation per se. Plus the battery gets discharged in half an hour even after charging earpods whole night. Also they are very uncomfortable and ears starts to pain on wearing them for more than half and hour that's if they have any battery life left. Please do not buy. Never buying or recommending boat again to anyone.
"What is this happening. When I got my courier yesterday, one earbud was not working and today I have both the earbuds not working. I have tried everything like reset and turning on/off manually.What should I do, how many times do I keep ordering the same thing?"
The onky thing I didnt like is that this airdope has caused a pain in my ear and I might beed to visit ENT... Think before you buy and also its chinese product... Ince u buy there is no refund only replacement but if u r ok with this all then over all sound quality is good.
I bought it at 1800/- (offer time)These airdopes are mainly for bass lovers!I listen to kpop mostly these one is best!The only con is - you can't control volume with the air dope besides that everything is perfect
"Great Bass quality,value for money but it's can not connect only with my Sony Bravia Android tv and sometime it's can not connect with mobile Bluetooth So,we need to reset headset and again need to connect.otherwise all are good."
Excellent Sound qualityExcellent talk timeExcellent micCons : It is not fitting properly into the ear and as a result it sometimes falls off .
"Left Ear has some problems,it may switch offOr showing Bluetooth connected (No media)That cannot play any media. But we can take calls.Good Product if we get problems free Piece.Recommended only if you could return it."
Sound quality is good. But while making calls the microphone has lot of issues. The voice is breaking for the other party.For music experience its good. Not a good option if you want to use for calling purposes.
"One of the ear plug has the issue, they have picked up from home on logging support ticket and within a week of pickup, I have got new replacement.Much happier with the Support"
"Really it's good, sound is 5/5, noise cancellation 4/5, battery 5+/5, grip is 5/5 yea it holds real tight if it slips then u should try different buds it fits wellGo for it"
It's stunning! Cool yet stylist and features are immense. Voice canceling is n another level. Dude it's faddu! Definitely recommend to those who love wireless headphones.
"I had bought this product on 14-Jul and in two days it was not working. On 24th Jul I had returned this product and after 30 days I had no response. Then I got replacement product but it was of inferior model, I returned this immediately and following up till date but with no response.Very very poor quality product and even poorer service quality. Will not recommend boat product. Poor after sales response."
"I tried everything, a different phone, factory reseting the airdopes multiple times, charging it for over an hour... nothing worked. My phone wasn't able to discover it at all. Also, the right eardope was unresponsive and wouldn't charge."
"A durable profuct, good if you like the vacuum sensation, otherwise will be painful to ears"
If you get it at 2499 go for it but if it costs you 3499 then stop totally waste of money.......The sound quality is okIf you love loud music and punchy bass then this is not for you because of 6mm driver it's produce low sound and normal bass....Battery is really goodOverall this is best for casual use but if you are a music lover and love loud music and punchy bass don't buy this.

 I received my packeged 1 hr before and one pod is not even turning on idk why, i had placed exchange order with this product, lets see if the replaced product is in good condition or not, I'll update on same once i received my replaced product"
Budget earphones. Could prove good for travelling and listening but you won’t be able talk because the mic also captures the background noise. Volume is okayish.Good guarantee standards. Got one replaced easily in a week.Best for the budget. Like a total pesa wasool.Have been using it since the past year.
I REVIEW THIS AFTER 1 MONTH OF USE.PRODUCT TO WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST ONE I RECIVED IS GOOD IN LOOK BUT IN THE LEFT SIDE OF BUD THERE ALWAYS IS A NOISE COMING.THIS ONE IS VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE BUDS DISCONNECT AUTOMATICALLY EVEN IT IS NEAR TO THE DEVICE. SOMETIME AUDIO IS NOT COMING FROM BUDS. ALSO THERE IS AUDIO BREAKING SOMETIME.
"It  fits perfectly in the ear and doesn't fall off while walking r running, sound and bass  quality is low, battery life is ok not too good"
"This product is every bit as a I had imagined it to be, it's a great brand that never disappoints.The bass and sound balance is amazing. I'm a happy boAt customer."
Sound quality & base quality is very good but noise cancellation is just ok ok..While  during calls it gives little bit disturbance in outdoor but there is no issue in indoor..Battery backup is also good..Overall this airdopes is the best boat airdopes in the budget of 2k.
"Everything is fine except the volume. Volume remain constant most of the time (sometimes full volume) and I can't control volume using linked mobile phone. It gives a volume hang type of feeling. Everyday I have to restart my mobile, then only I am able to control volume. Its irritating."
There’s background static in the left bud for some reason and the sound quality isnt great either when I play the music a little too loud. There’s a little electric buzz too when the songs play. Its cheap but not great for listening to songs. Good for calls maybe.
"After using the earbuds for about a month, the left side bud stopped charging altogether. I filed a complaint and got them replaced quick enough. But one of the buds in the replaced product was still dysfunctioning(different problem).Although, the sound quality of the product is top notch. I love the bass quality and they're quite comfortable."
Worked Good for 3 weeks then after that battery life gave me some issues.The right one just gives around 3 hours at 60% volume and left gives around 5+ hours of backup at 60% volume. Very frustrated after this but please consider other options from mivi or realme or JBL. They will be better valued your money.
Good battery life and nice fit and finish looks very elegant and classy but can't hear music for long time ears and head gets heavy overall performance satisfactory nothing to write about
Not a good product.Driver is small as compared to realme. So sound quality is not that great.Uncomfortable to wear.Main issue is that it captures so much background noise during calls that the other person can barely hear you.Accidental touches are also a nuisance and fairly common.Battery capacity is decent.
Bought it on 18/10/20.(review date too)..Had ordered it yesterday. Bought it at 2k. The sound is clear and good ..i found the bass great .. The touch control is also great..u can feel the base at 70 80 vol. light  weight so its best for fitness freaks like me ..also it doesn't pains even wearing fr a long time.. Go fr it..i ll update once used fr a month..
It gives freedom to do other jobs as well...the ear buds fit snugly in the ears and do not fall ...the connectivity to other gadgets is fast...a good buy
"If you want this  for listing  music,  its ok...but if you want to use it for communication also, like meeting, phone  calls...this is not the right product.Don't buy it"
If you want to use this for calling then don't buy. This is great if you want long battery backup and nice average sound quality. And also it has connectivity issue some time it does not connect need to reset.
At first i thought that it's a very good product in my range but after 15 days it's left bud stopped charging as well as it's magnetic power in the charging case decline and it makes the bud unable to charge .Unsatisfied with the product never going to buy any boat items and recommend others to not to buy
The product is worth the price. Decent sound quality. Comfortable fit!Few problems which I encounteredwere-1) Automatic connection to the Bluetooth  device is not smooth. One has to repeatedly connect(At every use)  even after pairing.2) The magnet does not gives the accurate fix in the charging case. Manual manipulation is required at times to begin charging.Overall happy with the purchase. Value for money.Battery life seems good. Been using for only 2 weeks approx.
Prodect wise everything is good super quality..Worth for money. This time I had worst experience with amazon develery for collecting my order i travelled 20 km ..This too worst
"Amazing product in affordable priceVery well designed, great noise cancellation and bass quality.Touch controls and iwp technology makes them amazing.Please don't hesitate to buy them after reading reviews like they have buzzling sound ,etc.There is absolutely no problem,they are super cool . overall worth buying them."
Quality is good but one air Dop not working well so we raise a requist for replacement. But we experience that the same piece  we received again. this is not fair.
"It works perfectly with the divices above bluetooth 4.0 but with 4.0 and below the internet speed slows down a lot not even useable eg- it worked perfectly in my redmi note 5pro but when i connected it with my lenevo tab 3 7 and samsung Galaxy j7 the internet speed was not useable at all so, strongly recommended for the 4.0 above devices."
The airdopes are a nice choice if you are looking for a active sport wear and for the music but it has its disadvantage like the noice cancellation is very poor specially outdoors so you have to speak very loudly in order for the person on the other end to hear the battery backup is average it could last for 4-4.5 hrs if listening to music and videos but if long calls are involved then the battery drains in about 3-3.5 hrsOther than that the music quality is really great
good sound and fast connectivity.battery back up is 4-5 hours. the case charging come for a week.
"I'm using this product for 6 days now, experiencing lots of issues. I can hear som static noise in the right earbud in silent area. Cannot able to wear for long time, after 30 mins my ears starts to paining. Oftentimes loose connection and creats 2-3 secs of delay. Overpowered bass after 70% volume.I was lured by the truly wireless earbuds but now going for the OnePlus wireless bullet z."
"I basically wanted to take my office meeting calls using boat AirPods but now one was able to hear me on the other side. Thanks that it saved me in few occasions when I had to answer few stuffs😉😉But I would say a worst product to be used with laptops and desktops for calling functionality , otherwise it works good in mobiles for listening music etc..."
Sometimes facing difficulties while connecting... while trying to connect both earbuds sometimes it is connecting to only one earbud...while in a call there is a lot of noise and can't hear properly from other side
Cannot be used as proper Bluetooth wherein u can talk on phone or attend meetings because u can hear what other person is saying but otherway round is not possible. Sometimes automatically stops receiving sound and then u have to again disconnect and connect again
"Though the product is nice, looks good, has less weigh, the sound quality is not good and mostly will give a feeling of feeble sound. Even after increasing the volume to the highest level, it's not enough to listen music peacefully in noisy atmosphere. Boat 381 is far better than this."

 Product  was delivered  in one day looks cool sounds good... bass is good but not excellent....quick  connect... fits ear perfectly and compact case and charges quickly.... I ll write review about battery life after using for a week or more... value for money 💰"
"They are not good for calls as even with full mobile network and keeping mobile nearby, the voice at other end is breaking lot. Not worth for calls and music is also not so smooth"
Bass is just mesmerizing but because of High bass somewhere vocals is compromised betteryof charging case last 2 days and earbuds allmost 3 hour comfortable fitting will never fall out best for bike riding and gaming
"Pros - heavy bass , aweosme sound quality ,  aweosme looks , premium case ,cons - call quality not good , fitting issues ,  price is high  acc to product , problem  in opening case and taking out  airdopesfinal verdict - good product if it comes in under b/w 1600-1800 ... if u will get in sale its awesome don't buy it in regular price ie 2500"
Very nice product.Blue color is really very classy.Sound quality is amazingLoud clear soundGood BassCalling is good but not that much. Outside home or in roads there will be surrounding sounds there.Otherwise great productBattery life is really good.
Good product by boat. I like the shape and and its fit in the ear. Is comfortable full day and does not fall off during exercise or playing.
Worked well for three weeks. I could use it while gymming. Even the battery was notably good. Only the capacitative touch was weak.But it stopped working. Factory reset isn't fixing it & I'm very distressed about this now. Didn't expect such a bad product from boAt :(
Airdopes is not working properly plzz exchange it as early as soon.i am not happy with this Airdopes. This is Very bad Airdopes totally wastage of money. And the amazon site is not ready for exchange .This is totally wrong thing. Exchange nd return is the company responsibility.
I was searching for airdopes which are comfortable in grip while running and that's the best thing I love about thiz boat airdopes. Sound quality is good....
"These wireless earphones are ok, not great. If someone is looking to just hear music, then it's a good buy considering the price. However, if you need wireless earphones for calls then these definitely aren't the ones to buy. Even in a quiet room, nobody could hear me at the other end. I experimented with a MS Teams call as well as a normal phone call."
"With the customer rating of 3.9 I thought it would be good to go. But I found that the audio quality is poor in terms of the clarity and poor bluetooth, slowness in response seen. Not connecting to the laptop. Bass is below average.Purchased with the premium model price the product does not give the result. :("
Best sound quality with boat signature base .for long uses not recommended becz of the pain it gives after long uses and noise cancellation is not good .Mic for outdoor is not enough most of the time .if u could compromise for 2 things noise cancellation and mic ...go for it best in the price range of 2000 .!
Boat has been my first choice when it comes to purchasing audio products. I preferred to buy airdopes for its sleek design but the dopes weren't the best fit for my ears. The design could have been much more better. A request for boat to offer all the ear bud accessories on all the e-commerce platforms.
"I ordered this for my personal use , while cycling , walking and during gym .the sound quality was very good nd it's very pleasant to hear on this headset , overall it's an amazing experience to hear a song in this airdope"
I don't expect this from Amazon.Its really disappointed me very much.From the 2 nd the it automatically disconnected  during phone calls.And from the 3 rd day right side airdrop is not work completely.I don't what what happen !!!!! Please don't provide defective product because it's not a low price product..Price is high but quality is totally zero....
"Whenever I'm on a phone call or a Google meet, it gets disconnected from the phone. Ridiculous experience. But if we are watching movie or music, it never gets disconnected.I like the design, the sound quality, everything. But it doesn't let me make a phone call with this.I am returning the product."
"Go ahead without thinking much, ONLY if the main purpose for you purchasing it is to listen songs or watch videos.1. Good Sound quality and playback time/battery life.2. Since it's my first TWS purchase, was afraid it would fall off, but didn't happen, atleast in my case.Not at all recommended if you're going to use it for calling purpose. Only you'd be able to hear the other person clearly, not vice versa."
"Using it for the past 6 months and it works fine, No issues. Sound quality is also good. No noise cancellation as described in the product specifications. So if you want to make calls during travel or in a public area this is not to serve that purpose, apart from that to hear music and watch movies this suits the purpose."
"I don't know whether I've received a defective product or the product itself is of poor quality. Whenever I start talking to someone, the person on other side unable to hear my voice, and it happens everytime. Don't buy it, its a total waste of money and doesnt serve any purpose. You can't talk to anyone with this device."
Not working after a month .my return policy also expires.
"Good headphones with good battery life for headphone and case. Bass quality is great only issue is there is some kind of constant noise disturbance at low volumes on the left earpiece. These headphones are good at high volumes and not the ideal ones to answer phone calls as it catches surrounding noise rather than your own voice. Could rate it above 4 but for the price of 2.5k, it is a good deal but not very good though."
"Superb and value for money. Sound quality and battery backup are feels good for me. They fits very well in ear and best for gym usage. Only problem is, the rubber grip causes pain in long time usage. But that rubber grip is removable. So if u want comfort for long time in ear, instead of fit, you can remove the rubber and use the earphones. Go for it."
"after 3 months of use, right airpod drains just within 15-20 mins but left one is working fine and giving backup of around 2 hours. not worth of rs 2000/-, although sound quality is good"
I got them for 1999...you get a bass as you get in wired earphones...fits well in ears and never falls down even on heavy shaking...vocal treble bass everything is balanced...u get a stand by of 5days...i didn't get time to check for how many hours it last in single go... according to my guess it may come for 4hours approximately.Conclusion: u can go for it when its price is 1999 without second thought.
The product is OK in all aspects only when it comes to battery it supports about 4 hours of single charge against 7 hours(as advertised)
Nic airdopes by boat 441.This is my first airdopes but I liked very much this airdopes.All over all future are excellent.I bought this product big diwali sale 10 Nov 2020 @rs 1498/-.
"Good for mobiles. With laptops it doesn't work well. If you intend to use it as a headphone for laptop while taking calls on laptop, then I suggest go for a better product. Not this one."
"Very sturdy, good sound quality and build. The charge also lasts as mentioned. Just would have liked sound a little louder and with heavier bass."
Music quality good. Call quality ok. Battery good. Compact size. Sits well in the ears for running and workout.
"Pros: 1. Audio is good, crisp 2. Had powerbank as for emergency usages.Cons: 1. can't wear for long time 2. If use single bud it disconnects in-between many times"
"It doesn't catch the voice. Regular breaking of sound occurs when on call.Pathetic experience in calling. Except that, sound quality is good.Pod charging/storage box is of slippery material.  It will often escape your hand.Overall all experience is good. But calling experience is pathetic."
"Really Good Quality Earbuds For Listening To Music, but not at all useful for calling in noisy places as the other person will not be able hear your voice properly and get outside noise. If you will use these for calling in a closed space without any background noise only then you can use these for calling."
This is absolutely garbage product from so called brand boat. Forget about sound quality! Absolutely no match with my oppo enco.Creating problem from the very first day and now within 6 months it's completely stopped working.Don't waste your money with this. Invest some extra bucks and go for oppo or OnePlus budds or pods.
Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.My right Earbud stopped working after a three month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.
"Very good sound and bass.If you are bass loving then purchase it without any doubt .it's my personal review afer 1 month honestly.............Budget RockerAirbuds.....Better than oppo , realme, redmi and Boult............Best of Best......"
ProsIWP Technology is pretty efficientBluetooth syncing among the ear buds is adequate not a frequent nuisanceGood Noise cancellationHeavy bassBattery life is averageConsSmall initial white noise at idle state when connected to iPhone SometimesBut the biggest disappointment for me was it doesn’t support multipoint you can connect to only one device
"I've used Airdopes 441 and now I've upgraded to these 441-PRO. it is exactly the same earbuds with a bigger battery case. If you're looking for 441pro, go for airdopes621 Coz they got a better design and a good case. IN EXACTLY THE SAME PRICE.Definitely recommended 👍🏻"
"Excellent service by boat on my first repair with airdopes 441, boat picked up my device from home and deivered new device to my door in warranty period."
good sound quality .. if u are a bass lover just go for it..touch are too sensitive so it may be a little bit of issue ..a bit of uncomfortable in earsoverall good tws in this range
For music for calls while working overall it's a good choice but only if ur ears are big and suitable for this ....I have problem becoz it doesn't fit into my ears and. After sometime my ear start to do pain ...alot then I remove it.
"Great product, good bass quality and noise cancellation at a good price, only con is the touch sensitive buttons, at times even at a slightest touch, music/video pauses/stops, but new age touch buttons are the in-thing nowdays !!!"
"As it's sound quality and bass is upto the mark as it has to be in this price segment,colour of my variant is also been sexy appearance and the last but not the least its LED indicators of different features do a great job but it only bothers me in one thing that it can be more flexible in earbuds because my ears tackled,complex and small so if I wear this for too long it hurts a lot left a mark in my ear which cause some little headache and neckpain."
"The left earpod makes screeching noise while playing the media. I did perform factory reset still same issue. The screeching noise is also noticed while the volume is muted, very irritating noise. Looks like multiple people have reported same issue. The sound quality is not that great either. Had lot of expectations with this product, total bummer."
Value for money. Battery backup is excellent. Sound quality is better in comparison to a couple of other tws I used(jbl and jabra). Doesn’t feel uncomfortable when wearing inside a helmet.*points about fit and sound quality are my personal experience and could vary from person to person.
Worked fine till day before yesterday. Then suddenly stopped working. Didn't drop it on the floor or expose to water or any other accident. For this price the shelf life is too short.
I am writing this review after using in for 2 weeks.Mic quality is good but it catches surrounding sound too much.If you are in heavy traffic area other person will not able to hear you properly.For connectivity when we place airdopes in charging case some time it gets connected to device and you have to close the bluetooth.
"Great sound quality, sensitive touch & long battery life. WNP feature really makes life simple! Great product in 2k. Must buy for anyone searching for wireless earphones."
Sound quality is good with the price range but I need to remove the rubber to properly fit in and to nit have any pain.Transmitter has issues my friends often say to not use earpods while on call due to poor transmission.Sound quality of right bud decreased over time but it is still audible with low sound after two months
"Packaging and Delivery: The item was delivered safely in a well packed manner.Product: Expected more bass quality. The bass of songs are not distinctly given out by the airdopes. As the bass is less, the sound quality also gets affected negatively."
The noise cancellation of this project is just dope! the sound is good you can hear the minute details which a speaker misses. Must give it a try!
airdops not working within 25 days... no support from amazon... pl. guide for replacement/return. boat has not initiated return pickup even after reminders....pl help
"Please don't BUY!Worst product ever I got from boat, from the starting mic was not responsive enough, I often need to speak louder to communicate to someone on call, or at times there was no voice was going at all.Also after one month use right side earbud gives very very less volumes as compare to left side earbud."
"Everything is perfect and best but not use full for recieving calls while riding as voice doesnt reach other side but other wise its good, and there is lot of ear pain if used for long time."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 What I liked1. Amazing battery  My daily usage- 3-4 hrs on avg  Last charged- 18 days ago2. Sound Quality  Good bass and trebleWhat I didn't like1. Quality of case  Box hinge has a little play2. One earphone doens't connect sometimes. But it happens less frequently."
"Using this product since one day..Pros:-Bass is very goodSound quality is above averageBattery life is good as advertisedComfort 4/5Look and desisn are damn goodCons:-I am using macbook so while using it with macbook air, I needed to change setting manually because of audio latency issue with macos otherwise audio was not synced and played it before visual.But after setting it manually it worked fine.Can not connect with multiple device even though it has bluetooth 5.0"
Every piece of song can be heard clearly and just love it
🟢 Very easy to use. One of the best things is that they provided buds of different sizes.🔴 They don't control volume so one has to keep the device near to them. For voice calls they are decent enough. When wore for more than an hour they hurt my ears.
"Best ever airdopes 🤩Latest technology like no one believe can powerbank in airdopes.150 hrs back up2300 mAhQuite worth buying itLight weight , Comfortable ,Great Bass and noice cancellation is excellent.With great service of amazon quick delivery.Worth buying it.You can charge your mobile too with powerbank facility."
"I have been looking for something like this for a very long time, these Airdopes are very sleek in design, comfortable to wear, and easy to carry. I've ordered a Red colour ones and they look great the touch sensor works wonders, good sound, good quality. Very relaxing...."
"The charging is drained very fast, other than that the sound quality and connectivity is pretty decent."
"Worthless , dnt buy. It gets disconnected very often. Connectivity issue is lot. U r on call and all of sudden it is switched to speaker. 😃Very annoying. Sometimes call doesn't disconnect through the touch panel. Although sound quality is good but connecting issue are more. Sometimes signals get disturbed even at 5 mt away.Its really weird i have to connect it manually everyday."
"Awesome product. Loved it. Perfect bass, perfect treble, perfect fit. Simply awesome.Drawbacks:1. Need to control volume from phone. No volume button.2. Due to capacitive touch, while wearing this music gets started"
Bass is not that much goodSound Quality is lower side (Not Loud)Mic Quality is wrost u hv to speak louder on phone calls.N one major issue for Sikh communityThey will turn of if u tie turbun on it evn little touch of cloth can turn them off cz they hv touch response...
"Really good ones, battery of the case in the pro version is awesome, gets you through the week with 7hrs(may be more) of usage daily.Appricate thr rubber grip.They fit well for me since my ears are big, i don't recommend for those Who got small ears.Only issue it has tough time connecting old phones.Overall good ones Boat!."
"The best thing it is really fitted in ears so you can do running , exercise easily . If you want music only then this is best, there is little noise problem when you pause the music otherwise its good product .Its case is not comfortable as you need to open it manually but thats manageable. You need to understand its touch panel not just button to click and you get next song . if you love sports then you love this also ."
It's voice crystal clear.Battery backup is nice.Bass is also good but not to much as compare to other. And fitting is also good .

 This is my first product of boat and i swear sound quality is soo damn good. Agar 60% volume par song sun rahe ho to 6 hours aaram se battery chalega. And bass is out of this world if u are bass lover than this product is for you. Worth it. I suggest everyone who have budget of 2500"
Amazing buds. I bought a blue one. Music and sound is amazing. Just some problem with calls. The voice doesnt reach well to others.
If I talk about the looks and design is awesome the sound quality  is excellent.High med low - 4.3/ 5Bass  - 4.8 /5Sound  - 4.7 /5Value for money - 4.9 / 5.
Good to have productSound quality is goodNoise cancelation is goodBass is also good but👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 if u lesion at high may ur ear drums may spoil
"It sounds great, and has a very good fit. Can be used while running or workout, but its mic is not very good. During calls, the other person can't hear properly. Go for redmi buds if you want call quality. Other that that its great for music."
I have used boat wired and boat rockerz earphones and i was satisfied by the sound quality of the products but this time airdopes did not reach my expectations . Sound quality is alright but when ur on phone call in doors. The people who's on the other side faces voice disturbence issues and there's no spare of ear grips and earbuds.  . Product could have been better.  I wont suggest this product for 2.4k
"don't even deserve a single star!!!Worst product, the product is in warranty period but it is showing discontinued sound. You can not listen even for 1 minute. They are charging 2600 and product stop functioning in few months only.worst worst worst only worst!!!! You will be cheated like me!!! Don't buy"
"Everything is fine accept the vaccuum it creates inside the ear. You cannot wear them for more than 10 min. The fit is good but it is very uncomfortable.Once you put them on, you cannot even hear the sound of the blast (which becomes the risk while using them when driving) even when the music is not being played.Wouldnt recommend them."
"Excellent airpods looks sturdySound quality is good.My first earpods, Boat is excellent as always.Go for it without thinking much"
"Had lot of expectations, but unfortunately found not so great product. When connected to laptop mic does not work and even sound quality is average."
These are nice earpods. They are my first tws. Fits perfectly and are light weight. Pairs instantly and no noticeable lag. It's nice
"Please do not purchase this, especially from Amazon. I received the product today morning and by afternoon the left ones stopped working. Absolutely no response. Its not even charging.Go to the official boAt website. Do not purchase it from Amazon!"
"Sound is very good but tha noise cancelation is kind of so poor and the main thing if it has mic then why not work with recording 🤷‍♂️, and sometimes its not showing perfect lightning it is getting charged or not when do some edjustment in buds with case its shows blue light means charged🤦‍♂️ not so good product, i will not prefer to someone hence it has batter aound and bass quality,."
Packaging is not good...delivered Broken packing case..(Now I got to know why they sell in discount rates and delivery such defected peices bought for 2799/-.. original 2999/- ). Coming to Airdopes..it looks cute and cool in hand. Except ear pain when you force press for good fit in ears. Hassle free use. Sound quality is good for now. Bass is not much appreciable. Noise cancellation is okay..
"All is good. Sound quality is good.But one thing is the problem, it cannot fit with your ear. It can fall easilywhen you walk or run. (Big Problem)When you insert it in your ear, you can not hear other sound(Any surrounding or someone calling)."
Very good sound quality.
Very nice and affordable product I bought it for my niece then my father and my son for his birthday and all are impressed with the sound quality
"Hi , With Mobile Phone these are working fine. sound also good. butI couldn't hear the sound of video any video playing when the meetings of  WebEx, and other meeting apps  on my Laptop. sometimes it worked fine but some time I have to re connect or use my other head phone.#boat #boatindia #boatairdopes441"
Got my order today (07/06/2021). I was a little skeptical when I ordered this as I have never tried these budjet version ear buds. Had to buy it as dad wants something inexpensive. This a really good one. He loved it. That look on his face made me so happy.
"All good including sound, design, battery backup, connectivityexcept one issue and that is even using both earbuds for same time (both fully charged) randomly one of them discharge early then other."
The sound quality of the earphones is good and the connect instantly but where the lack is the quality of the microphone. The microphone is so pathetic the other person hardly hears anything unless you are speaking very loud which is not feasible.
"I liked these. Though it's noise cancellation is not that good. The bass is great! On a downpoint, I would have appreciated if it also had a volume control. Yet, since it was already mentioned in the description so it's okay. On a whole, it's worth the money paid."
Besides being a good ear pod It doubles up as a battery charger too in emergency .Though makes the case a littly bulky but worth it in every sense . Using it albeit sparingly for few hours daily I have still not charged the case which shows two lights out of four .
After use of 2 months distorted sound started coming from L side eardope.Battery discharged without using.Sent for replacement. its over a week and still no msg about my replacement.Waste of money. Plz go for other brands.
Software connect disconnect issue..the manual itself is saying we need to keep the buds in the case and then remove it to solve the issue.  Even the older model had similar issue and need to do factory reset and make it detect for pairing. Hence I won't recommend it personally.
This is good keeping budget in mind.Though i feel it could have been little small.I have use only for few days till now.Will update after using for a month.Design is goodLook is goodBattery is also decent4-6 hours based on usages.
"I'm writing this review after 48hr of use, airdopes 441 have a good quality sound they have passed all major sound testbut they aren't comfortable , i'm 19 and i found them a bit large and uncomfortable for my ears.Final verdict:Pros:Best quality soundEnough of battery backupCons:Less comfortable"
It's awesome product with best sound quality bt there is one demerit i see in this the left bud make some horrible noise like khrr khrr when we use single buds and i think i receive bad product bt when i replace it the new one make sounds too.. the sound makes me irritating over all beast!! Go for it
Its been 2 months since im using it and its working well..Okay being honest i didnt expect that much from it...I cant believe it worked so well even after i dropped it in a bucket of water really impressed..!!😍I dnt exactly know much about bass.etc but its great for normal use but as i have small ears it drops often😑
"All i wanted is the best sound and ""bass"" and no doubt for the bass lover, my personal recommendation would be boat 441 because as i am fond of music with bass, i am always in search of an earphone or earbud which is rich in bass.and finally i got the one which met all my expectations.Thanks boat team!"
Quality of sound is good. Bass is ok. But it starts hurting the ear if used for over an hour.The sides of ear pains after an hour's usage
As everyone is saying left side always makes buzzing sound so got it returned... don't buy
"An Experience with boating is that, you start seeing the world in a new perspective and now with Airdopes  we experience a good refined way to hear music and sound in a different perspective.Being wireless has also added a good experience on hearing and see things together which is more like seeing the world while boating."
This product is ‘Made in China’….do you still want to buy???? I regret not knowing this before…
Bad quality airpods from boat. Waste of money. Many technical problem in aurpods. Right ear airpods not charging. Bad product from boat. Not recommended.
"Product is good. But battery backup is less than advertised. The real purpose of having wireless buds is lost. They are kind enough to offer a replacement. But battery time remained the same. Make no mistake, other aspects are good, especially punchy bass.Disclosure- returned."
Very poor quality earphones. Absolutely worst bass. There is no noise cancellation and the fit is ridiculous. The airdopes slip just by shaking your head once. Have been using them for a week and Its safe to say that I'm not at all satisfied with the quality of the product. Also the connectivity during calls is very poor. The person on the other side can barely make what we're trying to say. Have to disconnect them everytime I'm on a call.
I bought for my daughter. Its good as per description. Rest after  its fair usage time ⌚
Left side airdopes only working. Right side not working. Unfortunately I missed the return window to retrun or replace this product.The working one is giving good sound and touch also working fine.@Amazon- could you please assist me to fix the right side airdope?!
"Disappointed with the purchase. No clarity on calls,lot of disturbance and voice echo while on call. Dont buy if calls are your primary purpose. Sound quality is also average. If you want hear all the noice around you when you are on call or listening music you can buy this.Note . No return for this product."
Please don’t buy boat EarPods .One side eat pod is not working. Problem within one month only .went to service station and saw so many came to service Centre with this problem . Don’t buy war dopes from boat
Using from 2 months not facing any problem. We need to reset everytime if we change device frequently.
"Sound quality isn’t great. If you are a music lover, then don’t buy this at all. You cannot enjoy good music with this. There is no return policy too for this. Only replacement is possible"
Connecting to your phone can sometimes be a task...also no volume control on the airdopes ...have to watch fire stick on full volume!Otherwise very convenient and work like a charm
"It's just amazing.I used the earpod of noise and didn't like that much.But Boat, you r just splendid......Best earpod ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"I have bought 441 two years back and i lost left pod by accident into the drainage, but with the right pod it's still cool , i still use this man , money worth for 2.5 k boat really doing a good job with it but when it comes to nee products some of em have defects ( small defects ) just adjust those then they good to go rocking"
"One of the worst product as I ever seen on Amazon, when I was purchased this after four month it's magnets not working properly due to this I'm unable to use. I tried to contact through call center for service center but the service center address provided are not operational. Most of time they are closed and on phones they denied to service."
Seems to do it's job. But active noise cancellation should be the must at this price .Bass is fine. If you're a bass head go for it. Overall all it's good. I had issues during calls. As the other party was unable to hear my voice. Seems there's issue in the product.
"Product was not working....only one earbud is working...very unhappy about it...I returned the product...it is replaced once...both time , I got defected product...I never recommend this product to anybody 🤝"
"After using it, I can only wear it for 30 min, as after that my ears start hurting.For my morning runs when I used it, the music kept lagging / breaking.Wond recommend it.."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Cheap and best. Easy to use. Only weak area I noticed is no function of selecting next song."
"Only one bud is getting charged, need to do reset frequently. poor battery backup, poor bass quality, bit complicated to connect sometimes as there are frequent issue where only one bud will be connecting to the device , hence we need to reset it each time"
It has some problem with its speaker. The other person on the phone has difficulty getting voice properly. Also it requires frequent factory resets to get its touch functions get back to working
The quality of microphones doesn’t seems to be impressive as the other person on the call can’t hear you clearly.. your voice reaching to that person is very low
"VERY WORST Product. Doesn't work for Microsoft teams call. your voice will be very low , others can't hear your voice. People who are working from home don't buy this product.Bluetooth will continuously disconnect, Don't waste your money by buying this product."
"The sound quality while listening music and movies as well is quite good considering the price. Bass is decent and fitting and build up quality is good as well. But facing issues in using for call, as long as there is complete silence around you your voice will be heard nicely to other person. But if you are outside , calls will not work properly."
"When you want to adjust this airpod, your finger touches its surface and it automatically play or pause the music. Irritating"
"They're good if you want to use your earphones for an hour at most. The battery life sucks! I saw it go from 100% charge to 10% charge within a span of 3 hours. Don't go for it, you'll get many other better options.Noise cancellation is good though."
"Dont buy this product.  After one day, one earbud is not working, i tried everything charging the buds,  reset factory option,  change positioning of earbud in case. But nothing works. Box is full of error solution notes. But in actual no solution worked."
Honestly if it keeps dropping the connection with a small head moment... What is the point? Music dropping in the left ear bud is super irritating... Sometimes both buds stop playing and restart playing. When it plays sound quality is good...
Product doesn't go with the price. Expected a lot a than disappointment. Can't use it for too long period of time. Ears get hurt. Doesn't fit properly into ears too.
The product turned out to be in highly recommended and useful category. Have been using it since last two weeks- really turned out to be a value for money purchase. Kudos to Boat manufacturers for a high quality product.Bass: AdequateNoise Cancellation: The aesthetics are such that it seals the earsOther Sound Features: Perfectly tuned in for some great experience.
Im using this product the quality is good sound is good but when you fit this in your ear you can not fit for long time bcoz of pain and other dislike is your voice is not hear to other person bcoz of gap of mic and your voice for that you have to talk very loud from my suggestion dnt buy it if you want to just enjoy music then its only good
"This is amazinggggggg! The best wireless earphones ever! It is totally value for money and in this range the product is more than excellent! I absolutely love the bass, sound and the noise cancellation feature. I would highly recommend this wonderful product!"
The battery in one of the airdope doesn't last even for 15minwe get a set of earphone (airdope) for one the battery last for 2hrs while other one doesn't even last for 15 minso need continuous charging. or always use in single dope mode.Cheap Chinese product
If u are going to buy music listening pleasure.. Its not a good one. Doesn't sound stereo. It easily fells off my ears too even after using fitted ear buds.. Can easily lost.

 It's been 1 week I am using boat airdopes 441 its produces very rich bass I will give 5 of 5 for bass and vocal comes low if we compare it with bass but still beautiful if it use in 100% volume then in left buds hiss kind of sound produces and it's call as static noise in my case it produces very low it can't be recognised still the product is good I like the product and i will edit this review after using it after 1 months so be tuned"
"I purchased it in October 2020. It has been 8 months, now both the sides are not working. Left one not getting recharged either. 2500 Rs. This was not expected.Sound quality not good even compared to 600 Rs realme wired ear phone.I purchased this as this fits well in the ear."
"Please don't buy ... Nothing good about this Air- budsMost of people getting issue with left side air-bud because ,Left side air-buds is not correctly fitting in the case and that's the reason it is not charging properly .."
"0 points for calling ,every time I use for calling or meeting it start creating noise and create disturbance.But sound quality is A1.  IF you use only to listen music and watching videos then it is best earphoneBest service ever"
I order this product keeping that in mind that it has Bluetooth version 5 so it will support multiple device at the same time. But unfortunately these ear-buds doesn't support that. Sound quality is impressive.
"From using more than 1 month, on my personal experience ... I'm writing this ..battery stands upto 2-3 hours only then you have recharge again, can't use more than 1 hour you'll get ear pain, mic quality is very very poor you have to shout if you are in a call then only receiver will hear your voice.Noise cancellation and bass are moderated..."
Good quality at this price sound quality is good . perfect fit to ears.no possibility of slippage from ears.can go for a speed running without any hassle.battery life is good
"yeah as i mentioned the bass of the airdopes are good but you cant hear vocals  at regular volume that you actually hear on other wired earphones you have to go higher than suggested hearing limit ,seamlessly connects with any of the devices but i recommend to go with other airdopes if you wanna have a better sound experience priorly vocals"
This is just awsome.If your are a base lover then just go for it. Also it fits very well in ears and will never fall. No sound distortion even on full vol.I checked all reviews on amazon and youtube. Don't care about the reviews stating any issue with this product. This is just cool
Satisfaction with this product original product fastest delivery 🚚 thank you amazon
Very worst product.right side buds stop working after one month & this kind of thing happened with my many friends.And there is very poor service from Boat service centre.its almost 2 month i claimed warrenty still i dont get my product.Boat headphone is not worth service is too low..
Nice product & good sound quality. But it's protective cover not found on Amazon ????
So far good.didnt charge the battery case for a month.great deal n reasonable.
I have buyed airdopes 441 airdopes are amazing sound quality is awesome and long lasting charge. But some how you lost or broken charging case they don't sell charging case
"Over all a good product for music but on calls it gets disconnected from Bluetooth and connects back. It keeps doing it on and off which makes the calling experience bad. I have tried resetting and also replaced device thinking it could be faulty,  but still I am facing the same issue. Kindly suggest a solution."
"After few days one of the airdropes stopped working and no one is taking responsibility for repair or replacement, the mentioned service center at Hyderabad person says it cannot be repaired or replaced at his end. I request you to look into the matter and resolve the issue."
"Why product has manufacturing defect. 1st Order product was having some srimble noice when sound was increased. also there is lag while connecting. Replacement received it was having maximum problems, touch problem connecting problem. Also its not fit to ear its size is big."
"Bass is just outstanding! Touch response is also awesome. Fits perfectly inside the ears and doesn't move. The case is not bulky when kept inside the pocket. Superb finish and looks cool. On the whole, excellent quality bluetooth  truly wireless earphones at this cost."
I loved these dopes❤️If you are a bass lover with balanced sound preference. I'd highly recommend. I used many other TWS before buying this. And it stood out to be a king 👑 at this price point. Close your eyes and just go for it.
"Poor noise cancellation. Other party getting huge noise rather than my voice.Frequently disconnected during  on going calls.Factory reset done, still no improvement on issues."
"Perfect product if you like bass.Good to have this wireless, as no need to worry about dangling wires while multitasking during listening to phone/music"
The sound quality is goodLooks fantasticComes with the best charging caseYou need not to worry about charging the case at all obviously go for the 150 HR backup version
Wrostt product quality asked for replacement 3 times wd boat once I got bluetooth connectivity issue once disconntion of earbuds intermittent issue and now the product which has been replaced is dirty has ear wax and dirt on it. And fully scratched all over . It was jus month for the product and I am receiving such products time and again?
"Paid 3000 but device needs charging everytime , no display of charging status, max 1 hour it maintains , again needs charging, not worth not reliable."
It's an average product. Ok for this price range. For indoor calling can be used but no noise cancelation is available for outdoor calling. Can not be used for longer duration as Fitting is not much comfortable.
"The product doesn't sync well on both ears, audio lags in one ear from other creating echos. To make it worse, there's  a constant hiss in the left eardope. Sound quality is not great.I am returning this. Poor quality"
Wish I could return the product. Not satisfied with the quality. Thought boat is Indian made and superior quality but this is not made in India and quality is also poor.
"Guys this product is really amazing, don’t give a thought and just go for it 👍🏻Its noise cancellation works perfectly.Its sweat proof, i used it during my workout and it never came out even once.Packaging is pretty and small box is really easy to carry.Its also really worth the price, as i got it in only Rs 2000/-"
As expected from boat a great product under a great price it is totally value for money. I really love sound it is totally clear and perfectly balanced bass is good too and noise cancellation is amazing I love it .
The sound quality and the noise cancellation of the airdopes is too good for the price. Battery comes down to 40% after 4 hrs on full volume so maybe 5.5 hrs roughly once fully charged.THERE IS A SLIGHT DELAY DUE TO THE MODE OF TRANSMISSION BEING WIRELESS WHICH DOES NOT MAKE IT IDEAL FOR GAMING.Else no complaints
"Most of the time they fell down while your body is moving.also, the touch is so sensitive that many times when phone is ringing and while plaxing them on ear the touch functions and picks and drops the call by consecutive touches....rest all things are fine...quality & sound is awesome..."
Battery life is not good. One of the piece gets dicharge just after using for 1 hourm and then only another piece works. I don't know if it is manufacturing defect in my piece or all the products of the company are of same standard. I will not recommend such poor battery quality to anyone. Sound quality and other aspects are all good.
"Ya its good The noise cancelation is good , u can get a perfect balanced sound in between60 to 80 percent volume its quite uneasy to hear sound at 90 to 100 percent volume.Peoples were saying that they facing some problems in the left earbud but I haven't faced any issues in the left earbud, but only one problem is that I am facing problem while using the right earbud that in calls the person who is speaking to me can't hear my voice if I am using only right earbud........"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Bought this on 20 jan 2021 and today after 1 year 4 months it is working very well. No change in bass, sound quality, material etc. Charging time is also good. Only change is that charging is draining fast by 10 to 15% only and i thinks that acceptable."
"Superb product at this price range. I used so many ear buds but nothing like this in this price range. I used Hammer, noise, JBL earbuds. But compare to all this is amazing. Sound quality and noise cancellation is quite impressive. And they look so nice. Product quality is ok, we can't expect more than this for what we paid. I got this for 1500."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Loudly sound and Nice bass quality,*Must be in the right position, in the box*😉🤘🏻This phone is in the rain, but there is no problem.I'm proofed.*The box of the airdrop should be kept carefully, it will break later.This headphone is very good. This eardrop can also be used by taking out one of its airdrop!*I feel different using this airdrop headphone!😊🥳And this is my happy birthday gift. My birthday is August 21."
"Really value for money,I used tthis earphone for 6 months, and it is really aa truely hd dolby atmos and when you put it on your ears and after you will in the musical world."
"The worst buy ever. Other person is never able to hear me. Also, the audio is so much worse. I would never buy boat airdopes ever again. Buy anything but airdopes."
"This is a really good earbuds, even quality is nice, the best is it's bass quality. Its good for music and all. The grip and hold is also very good. For calls it is just ok not too great. Overall great product for this price."
"In my case the noise comes from Right Earbud When you change music or Volume ,The sound gets worse at high volume levelDont buy Please Trust me ,After receiveing it You will Regret"
I just loved it. Was not sure while buying. But liked the color. Worth buying amazing quality. Sound quality is too good. My 2nd earphones with BOAT.
"It's really good, and very comfortable to wear outdoor and while you workout it'sgod for calls and all but for music the bass drives are not so good, but it's best in it's own ways."
"Worst noise cancellation , and if you use it your ear start paining within few minutes and you can also get disturbed by your own breathing because it completely block your ear does not spare any small gap to maintain ventilation i strongly recommend to not buy this product , as being a customer  it's my duty to inform another customer  and  jaago grahak jaago"
"Battery backup is really bad , please don't buy these . 2 hours of playtime is not worth it and also always one side of earphones drain out faster than the other side difference of battery draining between both sides is more than 45 minAnd this is happening from first day of useI thought it isn't that bad but after a while it get worse"
"So i've successful used this airdopes for almosg 7 months now & everything is going well accept the battery life..For first 1-2 months it gave me decent battery life, like 3-4 hours.. but currently it hardly gives my 1.5 to 2 hours of battery life.. then i've to charge it again.I just want to knw how can i replace its battery!?"
Don't buy . I purchase this product in ₹2000 . After using 2 month my left earphone is not working. And other problem is after closing the case earphone is not getting disconnected.So please do not buy go with other product.Thank you.
Awesome bass..Nice battery backup...lasts longVery ComfortableLight weightCatchy LED lightsNice touch featureQuick connectivityGood call quality...not the best..sound attenuates(sound loss) a bitOverall the product is very good at this price
The sound quality is amazing.....and the airdopes are havingg deep bass 😍...its a must go for bass lovers...although left ear inpod may create discomfort as was the case with me...depend on ear type ...but over all good product.
it is not working with laptop.
"Good sound quality, base is minimal, no distortion when keep max sound."
"Please don't buy. Battery backup is worst, not audible to the next person while calling in market, case battery also drawn too quickly because of all this if i try to return the product there is only replacement is available. My money is wasted. They should know it is difficult to earn money don't scam innocent people."
The audio quality is good I have used this for six months but used rarely despite that one side ear the volume has reduced and the sound is not retriving I tried even resetting then also it didn't work so buying this product is waste investing on this is useless better not to buy this and move to oneplus earbuds that will be good.
"Good sound quality, but not easy to handle when your outside...as you will have to carry the case every where....the case is not pocket friendly...it has...this ovel shape...which doesn't fit in pocket nicely... sound quality is good"
"Im using since 1 and half month, i have kept this charging for case on sep 6 today is oct 24 still i have 25 % charging in the case...earbuds are giving super sound quality, super bass, reverse charging is not soooo good its average nono its below average... If u want in the low budget any earbuds means  ill definetly recommend this... HIGHLET IS IF THE ANY EARBUD FALL DOWN BY MISTAKEE ALSO ITS WORKING GREAT LY..."
Good quality safe and satisfactory packaging. Charge exists for over 3 weeks. I loved this product. If looking for an earpods for study purpose this is the best option.
"These are good but i have faced a lot of issues, at first when i received there was some manufacturing defect and that was resolved by warrent of boat company,  later after using 6 months again i got a problem of disbalance audio however again it was resolved by boat warrenty. So yeah its good but hope for no other issues."
The packaging is soooooo dull..they sent me the open hand box ..which one before open ..not sure the airdops will work or not ..but now let's see..because ..when I bought it first tym ... it's not working ....not properly connect with phone ...ane I can't listen the music..and. I replaced it with the same product..and the box is looks like using ....very bad experience ..
"Is that product was boat that was a asom companyBuild quality is good, sound quality aslo good, but it was not a good noise cancellation, noise cancellation is worst performance, am get this first order boat buds left side  bud was a problem like getting some noise while connecting to mobile, an iam doing this product was returned and replace policy I applied it will be replaced but the same problem happens in that replaced bud, when you buy this product you guys need to check properly"
"I am using this product from last 15 days its worthy, i m totally satisfied with this product, its Battery backup longer upto 3-4 days, bass sound is enough, clearify Cristal clear sound, also best for pubg players 😍, product quality is good👍"
"PROS: Good built quality. Looks very stylish. Comfortable to ears. Adequate bass. Easy to carry. Fun to use. Good range of Bluetooth connectivity.CONS: Not satisfied with battery backup. Touch is too sensitive, one can face problem with frequent call disconnect, music play/pause. Noise cancellation is just for the feature purpose. Volume up/down feature should be there. Multiple colours of lights are sometimes confuses."
I got this boat airpods 441pro in march 2021 for my Iphone 7 and it works perfect. The sound quality is awesome. The sensors works best. Noise cancellation and bass quality both are great. its been 2 months i have not found any problems with any of its features. The battery life is really amazing. Plus this is one was budget friendly.
"Sound quality is alright for its price, fits decently well. I've only had issues with the capacitive touch which sometimes doesn't work as expected and requires several attempts.The main draw though is the battery life the case offers! Have been using for over a month (daily 30-40mins use given we're mostly home bound thanks to covid), and it's only half way down."
Writing review after using for couple of weeks.Battery : Average Around 2 hours. Sometimes they over heat in box.Call sound quality : voice echoes sometimes and not fully clearMusic sound quality : Good enoughEasy to pair
"Product is nice but when I place these pods in the case it doesn't take the exact position means they will start charging from the case but I have to keep them again  correctly in that position.Sound is Good ,"
"A best one which I will recommend to buy in a budget. I have played PUB-G using this air dopes, the sound and bass quality is awesome. I will recommend to use this bud while watching HD movie or any action game."
Ideal first airpods.  They have good grips which makes sure pods don't fall down during jogging or fast walking. Only down side is the pods don't give any warning when battery goes down. It's just goes down from 100% to 0% in a second. A warning tone would have been more helpful.
I purchased many Bluetooth headphones but this one is the best. Super battery backup. Good sound quality. Instant connectivity. I am a happy with my purchase. Finally superb.
Can be used one bud at a time by each person while connecting to a single device. Value for money at this price however not the best buds available in the market. But I can be biased as I am currently using Jabra elite 75 active which is entirely in a different league and should not be compared.
"Its a decent model. Good noise cancellation. The grip into your ears are ok, fit in just right. The capacitive touch is way too sensitive.I keep hearing a subtle noise in the left earphone. I got it exchanged but the new one too has the same issue. Once something is playing you cannot hear it as its fine. A little disappointed with the product but for the price range it is decent. I bought it for around 1800/-"
"Picks up a lot of surroundings noise, so much so that the listeners on the other side complain of not being able to hear clearly. Big NO if you are planning to use for work from home.Calling in a quiet environment should be fine.Just for music? can do the job."
"Boat proves itself again. I was not confident about Airdopes series at all. But this version has taken me by surprise. Amazing sound quality, amazing battery life. Fits in ear like it is not there at all. Brilliant."
The earphones are quite good. But there’s no way they have a 150 hours playtime even with the charging case. And also they lag a bit in the sense they disconnect and connect sometimes. It only takes half of a second but it’s very annoying and quite noticeable. I wasn’t expecting this to be an issue.All in all a solid 5.5 out of 10
Call quality is good Sound quality is 5 o 4 no.Vineet panchhi bass you can n listening on full volume..Full noise cancellation best for outer use... And battery life is awesome using it from 5 days...Isse upr ram Ka Nam h Bhai...Only problem is not comfortable for small 👂 ...

 Pls chek the product before shiping.. I found small insects in my ear buds case and whem i put out ear busds from my ear there where also some insects was there i where shoked to see and went for medical chekup of my ear.. Can u tell us who will be tje responsible if any major problem occurs in my ear.. 😡"
"I bought it at 21 dec then its work very nice and good then at 6 Jan it's connect but not voice in this buds so I open return policy but not return policy available there now wht i have to do, icant understand I just lost my 2000 rupees..🤦"
Bakwas. I have ordered it wid lots of hope but it is disgusting. Rt one is not working properly. After 2-3 min it gets discharge & evn though its not showing chargingBttr i'l switch to some other brands
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Bluetooth is not at all detected. Ear buds shows only red light when touched. As it shows red light I charged it for 2 hours, Still there is no response of Blue tooth and lights."
Sure wastage of money. Right Eardop is not working from day one. Sometimes it works for free seconds. Most of the time battery down. I have used many Boat products. They are very good. But this one is absolutely disappointing.
"Product is good. Bass is decent. Good for video steaming. Comfortable. Touch response is too good. Must buy. I purchased for 1700. By chance, u like to listen to FM, it doesn't support. In fact most Bluetooth device don't support radio"
After 3-4 month one side cant work and not only me but my friend and family have same product facing same issue worst of money don’t buyService centre support so slow and many customers in waiting all means boats product so faulty and not indian product its china product
I liked this very much and even compared it to my Wx900B sony headphones. The bass quality is impressive for the price. It might not fit in the ear for some folks.
"Really love this earphones for its touch panel, sound quality,noise cancellation and bass quality, there's no lag with Bluetooth. The charging case is effective, but I just wish the battery life was longer for the earphones or charging speed was lower. That's the only thing. If you don't mind charging it in between your uses, go for these, they are amazing."
"The best leading wireless AirdopesSound quality and clarity is crispBass is well balanced , just amazing!!!Price - Paisa Vasool !!!!Just close your eyes and add it in your cart ..."
"Bass is too good, and sound quality is awesome. Per charge eardopes will last around 3.5hrs on high volume.As its been given 'water resistant' label, yes i does it job. Twice eardopes had fallen into water but nothing happened."
Amazing sound quality and noise cancellation.Battery lasts for about hours ( if both are used at same time)Base lovers must buy it.They are comfortable and don't fall easily from ears( even when running or doing any exercise)
"Had ordered boAt Airdopes 441 TWS to gift to one of my Dear ones.Upon unboxing the product, to my surpirse only the usb cable for charging was present.And the box seal was found opened when delivered. Worst thing to be expected when you are about to gift to someone."
"1. If you just want to enjoy music then you might like this as bass is good.2. If need for calls it's almost pathetic, it amplify other sounds more than your voice (no noise cancellation).3. It has connectivity issues, gets disconnected frequently, especially the left ear piece, so every time you will need to factory reset!"
I purchased the product few months back. It is good for hearing music. But I am having terrible experience while making phone calls using it. My voice is not at all clear to the other party. They are also having lots of back ground noises which are clearer than my voice.
"Have been using this for more than 6 months now, battery backup and sound quality is okayish, but there's always connectivity issues, one of them will connect and the other one will struggle. Also, the design is not suited for prolonged usage, becomes painful."
"I'm disappointed and will call customer servicefor the replacement, on 21st jan 2021 I placed the order got it yesterday but it's getting disconnected whn using from wifi, thats really irritating when you are watching any movie or series, it's simply getting disconnected while using it on wifi, I have checked it many times. Really bad not expected"
"Overall experience after using these headphones for 3 months is really nice.. only con what I felt is it's too much touch sensitive.. sometimes even if we try to adjust just airdopes songs gets paused , next song gets played"
The product need to mature a lot. Sound quality is ok and the noise cancellation is good. Coming to speaker not that stable at times it clear sometimes volume fluctuations is observed.Power for airdodes dosent last long near to an hour and case not quite tested.
Fantastic piece of earbuds by Boat!Noise cancellation excellentBass excellent at that price rangeEarbuds look amazingConnectivity very quickCharging box solid build Overall 4.5 star out of 5.Great earbuds under 3k budget.
Guys this airdopes are really bad after 1 month had a issue in left side one and the battery are worst claimed for warranty but in return they gave damaged one and again I claimed for warranty and they gave me the new one but it still has the battery issue I was tried claiming the warranty so stopped I suggest you guys to not to buy this product airdopes441
Best of best.really it's veen 2 weeks I'm using without charging.
"Really Liked Its Design and Fit in Ear. Awesome Sound Quality,  and Bass is Also Enough Good. Everything Is Perfect. Noise Cancellation is Not So Good. But Its Acceptable As works Best With Calls at-least for me."
Too good
"This ear bud works only for couple of months and then if you raise a complaint you get replacement and the replacement will aslo work for couple of months and by that time product goes out of warranty and the ear bud that you have is of no use. But yes, of you want to use this product for 4 or 5 months (arns 2 months original and 2 months replaced one), the go for it.."
I like boat only below reason .. rest other brand is good.. but boat in Indian Company with made in China product1. Made in India2. Service... best....3. Overall quality is good.
These buds are absolutely great sounding as thier looks are. i got the red one haha boys stuff when i got it it was on promo offer got it for 1499!!. The sound is amazing just loved. go for it!
Good for those whose ear are best fit for the rubber tips....Perfect fit perfect sound....None of the disappointment are faced yet by boAt....
One side  stop woking in just 1 month and they have taken the product for replacemnt or reaping but i am not genting any update from there side . When i chk on internet there are more than 100 people wating form past 6 to 7 months to get a replacement i think its a big scam by boat company
"I purchased this product last day, when it was received one of the airdopes were defective. The product doesn't switch on. Tried factory reset but with negative result. I tried to connect to my phone hoping that at least one would work but the product is not appearing on the phone itself. I am returning the product. Very disappointed."
"They are amazing, i love the color too, it's very bright and the bass is amazing, cannot adjust the airdopes volume which is normally set at 100%. they fit in the ear really good, don't fall off too,the case is matte black and is very small which is really good to keep on the pocket or anything. You get additional earbuds and one charger wire as accessories included.Please buy amazing product."
Nice and chepest one for 150 hour backupProsGood build inGood lookingGood service from boat(using boat for last 3 years)My old headsets are still working fine only thing is battrey became weekI had used wired also.... Even that also worked for 1 yearConsNothing
I love this by quality wise and looks wise its awesome but the only thing that disappointed me is that the right airport has to be played in 5 seconds otherwise it will power off after 5 sec.it just waits 5 seconds to play a song or anything.but it doesn't happenes with the left one.once i put the left airport in my ear it doesn't power off untill I put them back in the box.
1st reviewer :-) Got Boat Airdopes 441 Pro today. Good sound quality. Light weight airdopes. BT connectivity is fast. Charging case is compact. Airdopes get fast charged inside them. Type-C power input. Charging case has USB output that can be used as power bank for phones. Call quality is ok ok which could be improved. Has 3 size of ear buds for different ear hole size. Fits perfectly in ears.
Ordered the product and immediately the next day the left ear pid stopped working but started working the next day. Then after three days the right ear pod stopped working. Highly highly disappointed with this product after spending so much for it. Think before you buy.
Noise cancellation doesn't work.Audio quality Good.Please dont buy this for call.
Just superb! Bought as a gift for my hubby! And he loved it.. awesome for those who have to be on long and multiple calls...
"The airpods 441 pro seems agood device for listening music , however,  because of its make if one airpods fall down accidentally,  tgen the quality of that particular airpod 441pro goes miles down a steep hill....I think its risky to buy thesemidel considering the customer/ technical support on offerfrom boat."
Good but it covers extra voice on calls so its voice canellation is not that good just fine but i loved it anyway alot it connects even when the phone is in other room great but needs improvement in voice cancellation otherwise its the best in this range amazing
I purchased three sets but last set red color facing problem after using one month.when we call to any it connection automatically disconnected and again coneected repeatedly for same call
This the first day to using boAT airdrops 441 tws amazing sound quality and even touch control but unfortunately I was little bit late I have not updated with new version 441 pro its little bit more backup battery time... and if new version is updated with ipx 8
Better sound quality.. Noise cancellation is super... Good bass.. Airpodes are good... it can be operate independently... Received only one bud. Same rate in boAt website. boAt provides extra buds and an extra side supporter. Red color is not attractive as in pictures. But Green color is exactly same.
I ordered the product after somedays one earpiece stopped charging and working. I asked for replacement and new airdrops are not at all worth the money. While hearing sound I am getting noise and while calling the sound is not clear and loud.Overall disappointed with product and service of Boat and not recommended to buy the product.
Noise cancellation should be improved while doing voice calling thatbis average while travelling call quality not good due to lack in noise cancellation of the outside noise otherwise in the price sound quality is very good and the bass too
"The product is fine, but it lacks the basic functionality that even a wired earphones have, you can't play two media at the same time, this becones worse because we need to use it for online classes and we can't hear the media that's being played because you can only hear the call at one time."
"After 5 month it get battery issue with left side earpod,I had moving air pod also,using it more then year work well.boat is not recommendable product"
"Phone calls do not happen good. When using these airpods, the other person on the call is not able to hear my voice.These airpods only serve as a device to hear music and videos.Sound quality is decent.The battery life is quite impressive though.In past 2 months of its use i have charged it only 3 times."
Good Product for the money but lill Bass heavy and muddy Highs but its a Good Quality TWS
Noise cancellation is poorBut good & sturdyFits in well.The battery hasn't exhausted since the first charging
Bought the earbuds today and found that the Bluetooth range is less than 3m and not 10m as they claim. Returned the item and 500 Rs was deducted from the payment
"The right ear bud was not working properly....... its not comfortable to use for a time period of longer than an hour ...... the buttons on the buds are too sensitive, everytime you try to adjust the earbuds ,the content on your will pause/ play"
The left ear piece is defective. Like loosing connections by a single motion of body. How could we think to Walk Jog and Run. Therefore I'll return it. Thanks to Amazon to give me the refund in the very next day.
Sound quality and connectivity is good. The only problem is the capacitive touch buttons which causes accidental call disconnection
Review After 5 Months It's really Good product i got its perfectly fit in ear I never faced any issues Battery backup is also good it stays for long time I used it for movies / series watch In one day I watched whole web series
The sound quality is amazing. I'm impressed with the bass. Truly worth for this price. The airdopes work for longer time. Good battery capacity. It is a truly wireless experience.
"Makes humming sound when no music is played , mic reception is poor when using it for talking over phone or over VOIP calls especially Microsoft teams"
"Product is amazing with a clean, crisp sound quality and high, punchy bass effect. Only one thing is not good in this product and that is calling quality as it's a twf mic not catches my voice properly during calls when I am somewhere outside rest of the things are totally amazing. Satisfied with product"
I had a very good experience with this dopes but my right earbud's light indicators are not working as if how the left ones are working. The light is not glowing to indicate charging when placed in the case. I'm thinking of to replace the item after observing for another day.But the build quality and comfort is of 5-star rating
"Bass , sound and calling also good..but sometimes little pause is happening while listening to music.. charge was good and the case is backup for 3 times only...after 3 charges the case turning in to red that means case was lack of charge... overall very happy with the product with this price..."
"Sound quality is very good with good bass. But the call quality is not good because it catches lot of background noise and the other people on the call will hear annoying background noises. If you are looking for a earbud for taking calls, attending online meeting etc, It is not suitable for you. But if you are a music lover, It is the perfect choice for you. Battery backup is also very good."
After few months one of the ear piece has stopped working. There is no way to get this serviced. Product has gone for a waste.
"I Really Like This Product With IPX7 Ceetification And Offcourse Battary Life, But I Suggest If You Are Hard Bass Lover And Vocals Is Less Important Than Bass, Go For It ,Haevy Puncy Bass With Perfact Fit.I Buy It With 2500 Price Tag Boat 411 Pro"
Relatively the usabe  battery backup is 3.5 hours in the buds that I think is not sufficient and the call quality is not very good either sound quality is ok though
"Once they are connected to phone, there is a distortion noise in the left airdopes. While playing music, or call there is no such noise but when it is paused and idle there is distorted noise in the left airdope."
"If you want to buy for exercise or sport actuvity purpose, then I wont suggest. While running or doing some of the exercise, the airdopes may fall out as they are a bit loose. They provide you some ear buds of dofferent size but which are kind of negligible, they are almost same in size. Overall the product is great!"
My review after 30 days use of this Masaba TWS 👉✔️ Colour & design super 👌✔️ Best Sound Quality ✖️ Cons 👎not fast charging support but Good Battery Backup 👍✔️ Overall my experience with this Masaba TWS is best in this ₹ price ₹ rang....💐
There's always a cracking noise in the background when no audio is played.Output very light and inadequate.The earbuds are super uncomfortable.Once purchased cannot be returned.This product is not even worth 1 star.
I ordered these airdopes and i was quite satisfied with the product too... Bt after few days they stop working.. then i went for replacement... And they replaced the product too... Bt the new produc is worst... No doubt it is working bt sound quality is poor and i think the product is not original!
Excellent piece of buds at this price rate !It's rare to get buds which are totally bass oriented at this price level...plus it is very easy to pair!Highly recommended and kudos to amazon for quick delivery
Good bassGrt performanceNice clarityGood batteryValue for money
"Not at all happy with the product. Initially it works fine. But after a couple of days,the quality runs out.Would have returned the product but the window has also closed.My advice please make sure that you choose the correct earbuds."
"Worst product by boat ever, disgusting sound quality, left ear dope was not working and when opted for replacement, Boat service center sent a replacement after 1 month which was again faulty (touch not working), I opted for another replacement and it has been 1 month and I haven't received my product. Do not buy this product, a better option would be to burn your money."
"Hey guys, I suggest u can go ahead with this product.If your searching airdopes in boat I suggest this is best dopes I'm totally satisfied with this even u can charge ur phone with this,can even use as powerbank also please go ahead with any confusion! Dont bother about other negative review!"
"Build quality is good,It easily get paired withyour nearest device. Battary back-up is quite good. Sound quality is also justified at this price range. Only auspect that requires improvement is Noice cancellation. Conversation is ok untill you are sitting in a quite place.Products is overall good and is value for Money"
"Not a worth product to buy, Its just 5months I have bought this product, now I m not able to answer any phones or talk, only use is that I can hear songs or watch movies, and sometimes one side of the ear piece stops working suddenly and have to adjust with one ear piece, it's just waste of money 2.5k for just 5-6months"
"Battery backup, Audio quality is nice, but case label is not visible after some usages"
Sound Quality for listening to songs and watching videos is awesome. The design feels a little odd in ears. Easily Comes out of ears so be cautious otherwise you will loose them easily. Not recommended for calling over phone....i have experienced worst worst noise cancellation while speaking over  calls.
"One side is not working, not getting charge, it's just a waste of money, i will never purchase anything via Amazon!"
I wanted to return this product from the date i received. But i was given a single day . That too after 5 days . And on that day i forgot . Now i am stuckup with this product ..... 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡 forci g to select atleast 1 star
The left pod has a constant buzzing sound that is impossible to ignore. I've read that others who received a replacement product got another defective piece with the same issue. I will update this review when the replacement is here. Other than that sound quality and build are good for the price.Update: the replacement is also faulty. I think every piece of this model is faulty. I'll be refunding and getting something from another brand.
Good for entertainment and music. Not good for gaming. Latency is not correct for gaming. There is a delay in audio and video they don't sync while gaming. All the other aspects are good.
I have a good opinion on boat but this product is too worst. headphones model is not good and the voice is getting breaked everytime.Majore drawback is there is no refund for this. Amazon delivery service is also too bad. I didnt expected this from anazon and boat. Make sure your services should be good.
Works well with mobile. Have lots of issues connecting to Google meet when paired with a laptop. Rearly connects  to gmeet. Great battery backup though. Easily lasts 2 days for me.
"Amazing TWS Earphones!Pros:1.Sound quality is amazing2.Bass is good3.battery life is up to the markCons:Just the case feels a bit cheapIf looking for a good pair of TWS Earphones under 3,000 just go for it!"
When listening to music it is good. But when on call it is worst. Voice is not clear at all. This happens 80% of the times you make a call. Further if you have multiple bluetooth devices nearby then this device doesnot respond well. Also when you have 2 mobile devices nearby (bluetooth turned on) then airdopes gets disconnected all the time which is very very frustrating.
"So it’s supposed to be the upgraded version. But it’s difficult to take out of the box. Ergonomics are not right, so the finger is not able to grip it properly to take it out. It switches on as soon as you open the lid of the charger box so when you touch the earphone, it plays the music. For me, touch screen is not convenient at all and many times the touch is activated by mistake."
"The overall quality is just ok, the touch pads simply stopped working within a few days. I have been unable to reach their service center because of lockdown. The audio quality during calls is very bad, the mic has a lot of background noise. Will not recommend these to anyone at any price."
"The Product is Absolutely awesome with punchy BASE, crystal clear sound, balanced trebles and vocal and a decent noise cancellation.The InstaWakePair (IWP) technology is super awesome, and the fitting is perfectly fine.I loved the product and it's worth each penny❤️"
Boat's after sale service time is too worst and too bad. It came defective and filed complaint for replacement and they finally delivered the replaced product after 1 month and it was worst then then previous one . I have too again filed the complaint.  Worst one
"Perfect just what i was looking for, best at the price point, just wanted this for gym, headphone gets totally wet during workout"
"Excellent product..Amazing battery backup..Fits snugly, doesn't fall even on jogging..Audio is good n decent bass..I got it for 2.5k in Prime sale..Regretting should have ORDERED 2 more colors..Superfast delivery by Amazon as always..Thanks AMAZON..."
It falls off. And that’s worrying me. I can’t ask you to choose this. But it’s good for call and songs. Battery life is good. No noise cancellation. That’s disappointing.
"Earbuds are superb quality, the bass is very good, noise cancellation is very good no problem at all.the one thing I should mention here that the cap of the year but is little bit of a hard so it will difficult to fit in ears. It feels like a very premium quality product."
"This is suggestble those who loves to watch movie, exercise , walking and jogging purpose. For calling and all band is better as the mic will there below your chin. But mic will in ear itself so chances of voice break is there while bike ridingand cycling. And you should talk loud the the band Bluetooth speaker."
These are good for 3months then the problem begins one side ear phone won't work if we ask in boat site again they are giving replacement but every wireless airdopes having same issue....Waste for money these to purchase.
Good bass ans sound quality. Battery backup also
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 You are looking for a product with clarity in sound then this is the one of those good products"
"Simply amazing. Very beautiful sound, nice noise canceling, good battery life, connects within 2 seconds. I had got it for 2k. Is definitely worth the price."
"Honest review :If you are someone looking for an earbud just for the bass, then buy this one. The bass totally overshadows the music and you can't listen to it. After a point, you devolop headache.The fit is adequate, feeling a bit tight in the ear after some time of use.Overall, not worth 2.5k ."
One earpiece sometimes does not connect. sound quality is also not excellent with respect to price. Having used lot of bluetooth earphones in past I found sound quality is really average.
"Sound of the earbuds are amazing and suprb noise cancellation. Clear sound and cool look. I read the review of facing problem related equipment missing but i got all the equipments so there is not a problem like that. You will love it, go for the product"
I faced issue when I am using it at low volume as I use it at low volume atmost times returned to the boat for replacement now I had received another in which I am favig issue with the button again I need to send it back already 1 month gone without using it for a day or 2
The notice cancellation is excellent the sound quality is also great ... Good in bass but not excellent...The battery backup is just awesome ....I used it for like 4-5 days straight without changing ...and 3-4 hours straight on continuous usage
I have been facing issue with this airdopes 441 mic while playing pubg as the voice input is going through the phone internal mic. But not from the airdopes 441 mic. Any one else also fave this kind of issue? Also not able to record audio in voice recorder nd while making videos through camera app.  But during calls the mic is working fine. Share some gyan on this if anybody knows anything abt it.
I am using this earbuds from 5 months and within this time period left earbud battery is giving too much poor performance...after full charge the both earbuds right one giving 2-3 hours backup while left earbud is only giving 30 min backup.Now i called service center but no one picking up call so poor product service also.
The bluetooth connectivity was pathetic leading to voice breakage when on calls. Earlier I thought that it's manufacturing defect in particular piece. But the replacement piece received after that was way worse. It was a used peice. One airdope didn't charge at all. The voice breaking issue still persisted. Regret purchasing it.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 good sound quality and best in noice cancellation.easy pairing."
Its not upto quality as mentioned. Only good for music. Worst for call and games.
The sound quality and bass quality are excellent. I will not recommend you for running or wearing it while riding on a bike
"The Airdopes are Not good for calling someone or receiving calls. While on calls, robotic sound is heard. Although these are excellent for music purpose with great Bass, NOT at all recommended for calling purpose!"
"A beast from Boat. Battery backup is excellent, including the Airdopes and battery case. Happy to buy it."
Got these on a higher price in 2 days the price dropped from 2490 to 1949.There is no refund only exchange.The one I ordered was not working fine so another one in exchange and now I don’t wish to use it anymore...
With good sound quality with good bass when the volume is bit high. External noise cancellation also good. Perfectly fits on ears no falling fear .
"Good sound and bass, good buid quality, doesn't fit perfectly, latency in touch responses, mic is not that good,"
Right earbud has stopped working at all within 2 months and resetting etc not working to resolve the problem.  Warranty centre phone numbers are not of much use… useless product and company.
"Sound quality is good, value for money, some time singe ear bud working after reset both are connected, touch controls are not working property"
"All in all its ok, need to be a bit careful as the touch is toooooooo sensitive and sometimes annoying. My only concern is 3 hour playback, which it says is t hours."
"good call quality,one person to other person voice is clear, good for music but not wearable for long time."
"There was a problem while using on the bike wind noise is too much we can not here the call sound. Bass quality is the best in car we can use this easily while waking also we can here call sound clearly, I suggest you to bye this prodect The Amazon packing was too good no dent on the box"
I complained on the boat website to check my airdrops 441 pro the power bank is not working still in warranty but they took my all information and give me 2 working days to arrive in my house but they didn't come yet today is 5th day the service is too bad I am not satisfied with it very poor service
"It has its issues.. like microphone instability at times & disconnections at times..But as far as music & sound quality is concerned.. it is bang on ! And gives tough competition to well known established brands !""Buy it for listening to music, you won't be disappointed ""I am impressed with the sound quality for sure !"
"Vocals,guitars,drums and all other sounds are minimised to elevate the base. It's just boom boom boom boom in your ears while listening music. It's an irritating experience for avid music listeners. I'm not aware of any setting which could bring em all to equilibrium .Otherwise, a good quality set with a firm box alongwith. Huh"
"Very sensitive touch- that even a small touch by mistake will cut the call or music  and disturbance during call,we need refund so that we can order other boat earpods ,but the dealer will only replace the product ,what is the use of replacement that we dont like the product features,very disappointed"
I am using these airpodes for almost 6 months...i purchase them for ₹1600 via amazon on diwali sale..it doesn't make any hissing sound.. Satisfied with the product..for any more queries feel free to ask me😊
"Does not cancel noise. pathetic wearing outside.After 3 months, Right earpiece not working, battery draining out, pairing problem. Pathetic product. Dont buy."
"Easy to pair to the device, fits perfectly for the ear, good sound quality and good appearance. What I dislike is sometimes even the airdopes gets paired and connected to the device, audio isn't coming. For this we need to reset the reset the airdopes and again we have to pair. That's the only fault I've observed"
"The product is very nice , looks wise , impression wise , and the quality of earbuds is also impressive . I get the deal for 1999 rs only .The sound quality is also good ,Bass is been also good .Terrible is also good .Also it fits properly in ear .#)The accessories which you will get are in pics just go through it..Enjoy the sound quality , enjoy your momentStress less music ."
proc:good Bass QualityBattery is GoodCons:Charging Cable Too SmallVoice Lagging many time at receiver sidewe also not receive voice sometime.Touch also not work as shown in other Review Video
It's been quite a few months .... Observed one earphone get discharged 20 mins earlier tha. The other... Thought I was using both equally
It has stopped working in a month.Can someone please help me in claiming its warranty?The process of warranty is very slow. Boat is not committed towards its customer.Timeliness provided by company for repairing product exceeded the reality by far.
"Best sound , at 80% volume it can beat real me buds in bass quality and in overall quality is best in this price range"
Horrible. Stopped working after 5 days from purchase. Not a reliable product.Even Sound quality is not a pleasant. Battery Working time is very less than claimed.
"It has a better battery life. Sound is good. Although sometimes one of the bud gets disconnected but, you can easily reconnect. This happenes once a week. I literally use it daily and I am happy to use it."
I just brought two days back fast delivery by amazon...About sound quality just impeccable crystal clear and bass is really deep with better vibration and frequencyCall quality is good not greatCharge backup is also good but it charge faster in case and i can say at this price range it is value for money go for itLooks good premium and one hand use ...must buy
Happy and satisfied with the earbuds. Sound is perfect as per the price range. Good bass and treble. No complaints so far.
Very very good product bought it for my son
Pls don’t purchase pls don’t waste your money. Worse airdrops ever worst company is boat also Amazon offer only 7 days return where it will work for 7 days but then after it will stop working. I raised for replacement company replaced but again these are not working .. i wish i could give -10 rating
Using for last 10 days. Very good product. Superb Bass quality. Single charging given backup of upto 2 hours. If you looking for good sound with good Bass this will be perfect.
Absolutely worthless.! Worked alright for a while. Crazy interference with wifi during whatsapp video calls. And now broken voice and echo in the sound. constant disturbance. I AM STUCK WITH THIS JUNK
Best earphones I have ever usedIt has been 1 month I have been using them I charged them only twice the best part is battery backup 150 Hours🤔🤐Fitting is also good and doesnot fall from earBuy it without thinking again.
Sounds wise product is good but Bluetooth connectivity is very bad specially when u travailing...other side person not able to listen on Bluetooth u have to off your Bluetooth and speak on phone and now second issue is left side Bluetooth is not working anymore with in 6 month.... sounds wise and notice cancellation is good...
"I bought this a little over an year ago. And now the battery life of the earbuds is dropped down to literally 15 min. I have to charge the earbuds every 15 min. On top of that one of the earbuds has low sound and base. Due to its been few days over an year, warrenty period has ended and I can't even complaint or replace these."
I purchased this product which stopped working after 1 month and when I sent it for repair/replace under 1 yr warranty then they sent me back an old scratched refurbished piece which i don't know how many people have already used.Pl stay away from buying this product.
"It's been 3-4 months since I am using these ear buds the quality is still up to the notch. At first you might feel uncomfortable if you have small ears like mine , but after using it for a week or so it should become really comfortable with the product."
"Worst product,I've purchased it because of sale, but sadly when I received product, one earbud is already not working.Also the size of earbud is very large, doesn't fit very well in ears and that's why one can't use them for very long time just like regular earphones.There is also connectivity issue with faulty earbud."
"Haven't used a lot.4 to 5 times in about 15 days.Looks good, build quality is also good.Light weight, clarity & sound is goodBT connects really fast but distance wise it's ok. Don't play games.... No time so no comments. Not good for long duration (30 to 40 min is fine) ears painRating 3.5/5"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This is perfect choice at that price segment with capacitive touch controls... And the vocals is excellent... Bass is good and totally sound out put is superb... For more technology support and review check my YouTube channel "" Penta Tube """
"Sound quality is very good. Bass quality is superb. I took this earbuds mainly for phone calling but while calling I had to be louder, so receiver end person can hear properly and I had to return this. So my suggestion, if you want a earbud for calling, don't go for it but if you want to music purpose only, you should go for it."
"Nothing great. Many people suggested me BoAt. Sound Quality is below par. Bass is bad. Return policy is bad too. Battery backup is OK. Not worth the money.Understood one thing, Boat, ptron, noise all chinese companies are waste of money.Beats and Bose are much better. Will go back to my BEATS"
I am so happy for that....I suggested all amazone user.. without any questions you can take that...Awesome product........ battery life is less but allover product are good....if you play pubG...u will getl prfect sound.... otherwise what happened...sound is up n down....
"Wearing these earbuds is enough to transport you to a faraway world. I don't even have a count of how many hours I've used them. The sound quality is excellent, noise cancellation is on point, and bass is almost perfect. The only caveat, according to me, is that your ears will start to feel heavy after about an hour of usage."
If you are buying this product for gaming purpose  then dont buy this but if u are buying this product for call and music then its too good then go for it .For music it’s too good . One more thing if u wear this earbuds in ur ear and start listening music then u dont even listen a sound of bomb explode around you ..😂😂
Sound is fine but the only problem is that it is not properly fitting in ears and it will keep on falling repeatedly so you will have to hold or adjust repeatedly.
"Don't know why people are giving this product bad ratings .. This is a wonderful pair of TDS ,and the best in the class you can get in this price segment . No second thoughts , just grab them .. the best value for money earbuds you can get in the market . 👍"
"The packaging was good and delivered fast. Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze no problem in pairing with device. I have been using it for 3-4 days now and the sound quality is also good. I use them mostly during my morning cycle rides, the calls with Google assitant go through without any problem and the call quality is also good(no whooshing of wind) . I am satisfied with the product. Airdopes are good value for money."
One of the best war buds ever the case is a bit bulky because of the 2600mah battery have been using it for 4months now no problems with the connectivity and the case is rough and tough
"Decent Earbuds.Connect very quickly.Reliable performance.However, not the best for calling as the mics aren't able to pick up the voice as clear as one would expected. For that, I think earphones would be better than earbuds"
"The product was nice and served the purpose in the beginning. But within a period of 2 months, one of the ear buds became unserviceable. Tried to contact the customer service with no joy(as they were always busy with other calls even after staying on hold for a ridiculous half an hour!!). They offer product warranty for 1year but its juat a hoax."
Doesn't fit in ear properly and irritates if pressed more or fall down if not pressed. Not recommending. Go for non silicon cushied one.
Could have been more of a Snug-fit.Battery life is awesome.Not as much as noise -cancelling as you think it might be but yeah worth it !
"I personally won't recommend these ear buds. The sound quality and bass is good but left bud got some problem it comes out everytime. Also a big problem is if you mistakenly touch one of the earbuds, the call gets disconnected or movies/videos you watch gets paused. Not worth the money"
Very Nice sound qualityEverything is clear hearingBass and trouble very very niceBluetooth 5.0 connectivity excellentNo problem.
Noise cancelling is zero bass is too punchy that's good quality for those who love bass and sound quality is average and also fitting issue who has small ear there is chance of falling from ear.
Till date going good and i am hoping it wont let me down. At this price it seems to be a better option than wings and boult
"Sound quality is Good.Battery backup is excellent. Its been more than 10 days and still 1/3 of battery is left in the case. Backup is exactly as promised by Boat.However, noise cancellation is poor. Boat needs to work on Noise cancellation.I got it for 2500. Its a deal price. Worth for the price."
"Excellent product from boat and bass is super. Correct fitted to my earsBut not delivered intime, Amazon delivery tooooo late worst experience"
I will rate Amazon for fast delivery but this product is absolutely bad.... I got a sealed pack product and when I took it out of the box it was non functional. The right ear bud was not properly working. Got it replaced but the replacement product had an issue with BT connectivity. I will suggest not to waste money this boat airpods 441 model.
Do not buy the product. I purchased it in Oct 2020 and twice it has malfunctioned even after the replacement from the company. It's cheap and durability is worst then Chinese products.Now I believe that always buy genuine and good products and not to fall for heavy discounts and cheap products like Boat

 Finally received this beautiful and amazing product on 21th of may and after using it for a week im glad to share this review that dont go for the bad reviews and bad comment these are best in quality and easy to carry in pocket, i'll say go for it without any hesitation in your mind good in sound and bass is extremely amazing 💯"
Boat is not reliable. I have bad experience with 2 product. Wired earphone stopped working after 10 months of use. I purchased this Air dopes 441 and within 3 months 1 side stopped working. Don't buy. Its just cheap Chinese material.
I love this product 😍It is very good in bass and connectivityAnd also good in pairingFor the bass Loves good productAnd good fit in ear but little pain in ear with big clips but you can change it to smallI will edit my review after 1 Month how it is performing after 1 Month
"Good at this price. Bass is good 👍. Perfect noise cancellation so beware while on music, become deaf to other voices 😄"
The product is amazing. The build quality is up to the mark and it's value for money. The sound quality is nice. Touch sensors are amazing.
"Sound quality is good, but not good for callsYou can't do much with the button which is extra sensitive and overall practical useability is not that great.Charging in the pod is erratic...sometime it doesn't work. Voice commands don't work smoothly either"
1. Connectivity issue2. Doesn't show the correct percentage of charge3. Might get disconnected while in a call.Or else it's working perfectly fine . I have been using yover six months now. Battery backup could be better but it's a good product iin general
"The product quantity is at par but the problem is with its fitting Ear. It won't fit perfectly in small size ear. So think twice, thrice before buying because Return is not possible. I'm stuck with this. If anyone is interested to buy it let me know. I'll sell it lesser cost."
Purchasing this second time because i lost the first one that's how powerful and amazing this product is i bought this item second time and trust me I am very economical while spending money......if you have enough money and want something which give you all services which they claim then you should go for it.
If you could add more touch controls and a little more noise cancelling it would be the best affordable tws earphone. And you could also upgrade the mic quality for calls.

 Good sound, bass and battery but not much comfortable for ear, it dont fit in ear much... Only habitual person can use it long last... Some time distrubance in call comes."
"Full marks for their ""IWP Technology"" (Insta wake and pair) but the connection isn't stable AT ALL; one of the buds keeps switching off, needs to be reset.Don't buy if you are planning to use it with laptops (or Apple devices in general).Sound quality is above average, given the price.Overall, it's Just another bad attempt at making TWS."
Worst product.within 3month stop working. After complain register they pick up the product  and return next day. Not expected from boat like brand. Now only hope is Flipkart.Don't buy any type of Boat product.
"sound quality is good, bass is good, feature to charge is awesome in emergency, only issue is with connectivity, takes  some time to connect even if it is previously paired with the device"
"Everything thing is perfect... sound, noise cancellation & offcourse the bass is excellent..."
Worst product ever. 1st one stopped working in return period so ordered a replacement. 2nd stopped working after return period so stuck with this piece of crap. 2000 down the drain.
I bought boAt Airdopes 441 Bluetooth on 045 march.  It is not working properly and bluetooth is getting disconnect frequently .  When I am trying to register a complaint it is asking me to go to service center which is 25 km from house. Pl exchange my airdops else it would be my last Boat product.
"It's an amazing product, but the earbuds are slightly bigger than other airdopes. Amazing one"
"I trusted....This Boat Airdrops 441 product is good. My bad luck which I used product is not good. Voice is not clear, options also not working properly. Due to this reasons...I want replace my used product."
Review after 5mins of usage gud product1500 is gud price for this item... little high price
"Nice product , had to exchange twice but finally good a non faulty piece customer care people were helpful in getting the faulty piece replaced twice .."
"Sent this product for repair 2 times in the first 4 months after buying. After 1 month of operation, one of the buds stopped working. After it came from repair, with 15 days mic stopped workingApart from this frequent disconnection from mobile and people are unable to hear properly on the other end.Don't waste money on buying these."
"Not as good as shown you can buy, it is sport friendly, battery backup is of almost 10hrs including case NOT 25HRS  and also when battery goes very low it's bluetooth become uncontrollable means it activates itself even in case,Customer support is very low msg is not comming from server for replacement."
Sound and bass quality is really good. And its a good fit in my ears.The only issue i face is with the microphone. It picks up alot of background noises. Its hard to make conversation with it in public or in places where there are some noises. And also we need to speak in loud for it capture the sound properly.
"Ear buds are good, when we plug them in we won't be able to here anything even if the music is off, these are mainly for the people who prefer listening to music during work out, sometimes it's not working for calls, I'm giving this review after using them for 2-3 months."
I've no words...  I'm totally in love with it!It's perfectly working 24/7 and battery back up is excellent!
The left earpiece had noise coming out of it every time I played the audio and it stayed for some time after pausing the audio
"Product good but traveling experience is worst , its capturing lot of outside noise , receivers cannot hear our voice properly"
Intially i felt very good but later started facing problem just like a wired ear phone. It will stop as of a sudden and i need to tap tap tap till it set up. Worst experience with in one month of usage. Not at all happy dont go for it guys. Better find good product for this price
"Everything else is fine, but noise cancellation is not there at all. While in calls, outside noise will be more than our voice. Sometime, there will be sync issue with both the earbuds.Bass quality is decent.Sound quality is also good.Battery in airdopes and not good. But case’s battery back is very good."
We got this product as a gift and the earhones work ok while used for music but terrible call quality. Since it was a bday surprise we could not exchange or cancel through amazon. They have extremly bad customer service at boat. Its been a month and they are yet to schedule a pick up ! Inspite of everyday follow up. My 1500 bucks is gone down the drain.
"This Is a Pretty Good deal , the Audio is quiet Sharp and has a good bass .  calling at outdoors is not that good it's a 7/10 Experience for outdoor calling and overall I would rate this 8.5/10 . At this price Range it's a good Deal , I wish it had more battery life ."
"Best product with best sound quality and superb bass  , bettery backup is very good, it can be used for 4-5 hrs non stop and with case it can be charged 5 times giving a total of 25-30hrs playback time. The only drawback i found is not so comfortable in ear for me atleast , it fits perfectly but doesn't feel so comfortable ."
I purchased this last year and till now I just used it maximum 5 to 10 times. Sound quality is so bad. It Unpair between your call. After exchange now again facing sound problem.  Connecting but can't hear anything. No service center facility hear so please don't waste your money to buy it guys.
Awesome Product..😍Good Bass.. Best Part that it get perfectly fit on ears.. Fabulous sound quality.. Battery backup is also quite good with case 13hrs battery backup.. On call voice is very clear.. Don't think more.. just go for it.
"Battery life is excellent, sound quality is good too ..but the bass quality is not as expected. Once my left earbuds didn't work so I performed the factory reset and it's working now.  During calls sometimes voice might crack. Overall it's good to use , doesn't give much of a disturbance .It's just been a week since I used it and this is what I experienced."
"It's value for money, connects quickly and easily, I am getting backup of 3.5-4 hrs per charge, good enough for a movie, built quality is good so is the sound quality, i wish bud size should have been small bit, overall I am satisfied with product"
Please guys don't buy this product I purchased and in a single month got issue twice with new and replace both product as no media sound coming but calling sound is fine.
Battery of earphones runs out in about 2 hours if used continuously. So you can maybe use it as an emergency backup only
"i have received the product but there is one defect that left earbud is not working properly and right one is working excellent , so i have requested for replacement now please provide me new and seal pack box so that i can get both eardbuds in fine condition."
I buy it on 25 oct 2020 and sound quality iz perfect but battery backup is bad one side only work for half an hour....  Other one is good so i wanna replace it or fix this up....  It has one year warenty
The design is compact and goodOver all sound quality is good but lil more bass which is good for someone who loves bassThe call quality is terrible don't even think that you will talk comfortably with this product.The battery percentage given is manageable not so long not so shortGiven the price this is not a disappointing product
Customer service of boat is terrible. I am writting this after tolerating 2 month of bad customer service experience. In case your product damage then they give you product which is available at service center irrespective of colour of your product. And that is not guaranteed that replaced product delivered to you is worling or not.
A good budget level ear buds. It does what it says. The foaming for inner ear placement could have been better. But overall a decent buy for the money.
"It has been 3 months since i got the delivery of the best airpods , These have awsome sound quality &  love the bass !!!An personal suggestion if you are looking for a bluetooth airpods do give the Boat Airdopes a try ."
A very good productGood sound qualityVery sporty lookNice quality of LED lightsFits in ear perfectlyGood quality CTCIWP technology attracts the most
I like this because of so many different reasons but the best part of the product is it's battery power that also work as power bank in emergency situation and it's water resistant... if u want to invest on a good product you should give it a try...
"Really happy with the product. Good value for money. It's easy to fit into the ears, sound quality is suburb. The best part is the battery back up in the case. Once charged, No hassle of charging your pods for a long time. Ideal for travel"
Sound quality is excellent.. This is a master piece for the music lovers.. Immersive base will make you each song a new level.. Connects quickly. I found a only drawback is speaking. Some of my friends asked me to unable to hear your voice clearly.. We newd to talk bit loudly to overcome this..
"Worst product plz don't buy it you will regret buying it for sure. My left ear bud not working just brought it previous month.Also, This Amazon Seller is worst as it's not Returning the item. I am even ready to buy something else from their Products (Different Earphones / Neckband)."
The bass quality is really good.. touch senstivity can be improved and not having volume adjustments is a major drawback according to me..if you switch from music to any other video then volume needs to be adjusted everytime from the device..the earphone grip is also not as good as i expected..
Never expected such poor quality. The airdopes stopped taking charge after 4 month's of use. The right one is permanently not working. My 2500 rs went down the drain.
"Good sound quality but falls out of the ears all the time. While touching the surface to put it back, however, audio stops and calls get cut. Playback time once charged is okay. Otherwise quite portable and budget-friendly."
Waste of money. Sound quality somehow good but this doesn't hold tight. It drops out from the year. Sometimes connect both the buds sometimes only connects one to the Bluetooth.Boat products have really become so bad in quality.I would not recommend to go with boat products. Services are so bad.
"Product recieved on 22nd october 2020, packing box was not damaged but product quality is not good..and airpod is not comfortable in wearing ,didn't get set in ears..every time it get fall from my ears so i asked from amazon to return it but they refuse for yhe same ....in this case behaviour of amzon is not good so DONT PURCHASE THIS FROM AMAZON"
Really good product for listening song and audio outputOnly drawback back is on calls voice clarity is not their
"So these are my first TWS earphones and man, they are so great. Perfect sound balance, bass is awesome and got them for 2499 in Amazon prime day sale.PS. DO NOT BELIEVE IN NEGATIVE REVIEWS, JUST BUY THEM WHENEVER YOU GET HANDS ON.CHEERS!"
"This has decent sound quality, although bass and noise cancellation are OK, and not that great as compared to an earlier earbuds I purchased at similar cost."
"passed the psytrance testnot quite loud enough, though"
"The earbuds are good quality and comfortable. The sound quality is also good but when I have to switch between 2 devices, it takes time. Many a times I need to place the earbuds in the case again and take it out for it to get connected to right device. If only it was quick in switching, I would have given 5 rating stars."
Wrost product wrost sound quality
Best earpods charge wil comes around 4-5 hrs u can also use single other one keeping inside box it wil be offf it only work when u remove it frm box googl assistant siri wil not work as expected
"Really worst services from boat, After one month I got problem one of earbud I requested for repair. They picked up. But still 3 after  month I didn't get back my Ear buds from boat. I was trying to call them but no one picked up my call . I mailed but no reply . Fake products fake service please do not buy this product"
"After replacement this productThey given old repair one,I found fingerprint on airdopes,And found a micron hair,And the sound was bad.The other person could not here my voice clearly.I felt better and good, go to with OnePlus bullets wirelessZ"
"Perfect pack is 441 buds but 441 pro version of this would help you to keep connected more hours, though the features of both 441 pro and 441 are same."
"Everybody claims that it has the most balanced sounds, but it sounds pretty low. Also I am not getting refund option, only exchange."
"I have been using this earbuds for around a month now... Sound quality is awesome, earbuds have a playback time of 4.5 to 5 hrs and with charging case its superb... I have charged the case once is 15 days... Only issue is my ear pains wearing the earbud since my ears are small, it must be comfortable for other people..."
"Nice product. Got a static sound on the left earbud, called for replacement lets see what happens.After 3 weeks, believe me i replaced and reordered 4 times such that i used 4 products and each of them has that silly static noise coming when the music is stopped or at low volume."
"So coming to the point .. the bluetooth connection, noise cancellation,  sound quality, nd the bass quality all are so well good nd a case is so well designed and it is a much protective case..So i can say, if u r searching for earbuds which should be under 3000, i can blindly suggest u to take this Truly Wireless Earphone - "" Boat Aordopes 441""Otherwise if you having a still any queries about this u can watch reviews about this AIRDOPES, which is in the YouTube."
Music and bass quality is superb connects well . Not at all good for calling other person is not able to hear if u will literally speak like shouting then voice will be clear . For only Music lovers  this is a yes and for calling big no .
"Awesome earbuds but pain in ears while using them, overall best battery backup. Sometimes falls down from ears"
"The sound quality is up to the mark the only major drawback that I'm facing us that it's getting disconnected automatically, even though on my phone it's showing connected the sound comes from the  mobile speaker instead of the headset, I have to again disconnect them and connect it again major disappointment regarding the connectivity"
Very worst for this much money. Sound quality is low. Bass is low. Faced some connections issue aswell.Only thing I just satisfied is battery charge in both earphone and charger case is good.
"Really great earbuds, sound quality was amazing, the bass was punchy, and treble was awesome, compact design, the battery backup was aroun 3hours with box you can get upto 1 day."
Sound quality is very good... But it's good to hear music only.. The other person Can't hear a word during calls. Not for making and taking calls
Good product as I have used earphones of boat the sound quality is great.About the airdopes overall it's a great catch.Noise cancellation it's not so good still in this budget you are getting a nice product.I like the spirit lime colour and its looks really cool.
My left earbud stop working from 1st day only now my both ear buds stopped working please tell me where I will contact don’t purchase these ear dope
"Not working properly , has a weird disturbing sound in one of the the earpod ,don't buy this"
"Very bad experience. It is not of good quality. It did not work as expected. It disconnect to mobile very frequently and if anyway connected then call receiver always complaint about not audible, it's mic is horrible. I want to return it back."
"It is not good for laptop. Other person would not be able to hear if you call anyone from laptop. Works good with phone. Battery back up pretty good.  If you want an earphone for office purpose, please do not buy."
"It's good but not up to mark,I am a bass head though I will give 3/5 overall for bass quality. I also have realme buds air2 which produces much high bass and volume and it also has much key feature like active noise cancellation ,game mode,bass mode, transparency mode which are really useful."
"Earphone are good for just music ..Its very worst regarding calls ,noise cancellation is ZERO .The bluetooth constantly keeps on diaconnecting  multiple times during calls .. Even when its near the phone ..Not at all recommended ..Plus ,there was no return policy .. It was just replacement which is useless ..."
This piece I had gifted to my friend. She faced a lot of issues. The Bluetooth connection keeps on breaking in between calls. Had to struggle a lot to get it exchanged in company.
Best one in this price range...offers good sound quality and allows instant connectivity...but I still recommend you to check out the Pro version of this model if you want to have battery life 5 times more than this one.
Received defective product I guess. Felt like the music was playing through one side only. The left earpiece worked perfectly fine but the right earpiece had no bass at all and even the volume was low compared to the left one.Returned the product back and got a refund. The process was smooth and had no issue in doing so.
Does pain in the ears after wearing for more thn 30 mins. Falls off if not pressed deep in to ears. Fitting isn't too comfortable. Avoid if possible. Music and voice clarity is ok..but if possible go for some other product in the same or slightly higher price. Reviewing after 1.5 months of use. Overall 2.5/5.
When opened a case. Found only one earbud working. Tried to carry out factory reset but no good. Didn't expect from one of the best upcoming brand of India. Extremely disappointed. Asked for replacement from Amazon. Willput up a reviewe very soon.
Do not buy this guys because i had to replaced this product in just a week because one side of Bluetooth stops working while playing music. Moreover sometimes don’t connect each pair. Once again refunded product has also occurred same problem i.e right sides ear bud has stopped working and not pairing from the device. Such an act of waste of money
"Awesome product... with best sound, bass performance and bluetooth connection...I like the product design and the cute box..."
"Amazing bluetooth connectivity ,it just takes fraction of seconds , and for the price of the product ,it's value for money . So just keep buying and stop your research here 😉"
"Bad quality. Bought this 3 months ago and now the left side of airdopes does not work. Also the battery drains faster. Totally unhappy with the product. Waste of money.When i returned it for replacement i got different colour, so i returned it again and again i got different colour, and now i have to use that. I never got original black coloured airdopes again."
It's been almost 15 days I'm using this. The sound quality is fine but connection is an issue. One of them disconnects automatically when you're working out or just moving around within the range of bluetooth. Atleast they don't fall off. The sound quality is just fine. You can not adjust the volume with the headphones.
Mujhe 21st April ko delivery ho or tab se use kar raha hu abhi tak mujhe koi issue nahi aaya bass isme jyada nahi hai sound quality achi lagi calling mai bhi acha kaam kar rahe hai gaming mai bhi ache hai kabhi aad hi latency lagti hai lekin bilkul sahi kaam karte hai
"My left side ear bud stopped working and heating issues after 3 days of usage.. and when we use both earbuds for calling only one side mic is working... When we use individually both are ok, may be same fo all. Sound quality is  good for bass lovers.. anyway returned and waiting for refund/replacement."
"Mic is not working properly. When I attending a call, others are not receiving my voice properly (connected with mobile as well as laptop). I thought to attend office meeting by connecting with this airdopes. But it is not working properly. While speaking without connecting airdopes, ask are hearing my voice properly."
If for some reason the connection is lost then it has to be put in the box again. Manytimes any one of  earpiece gets disconnected. It irritates much.
"Too much bass and noise cancellation does not work, mic us not powerful U have to talk loudly, and after one month left piece didn't work well."
"Product is good but in third month battery issue started. I love product but no. Of times product gives distorted music. I so much love this product that again I want the same product after replacement, can any one help me pls."
"It's really amazing productI n fall in love with this amazing weaponSound quality is really very amazing , loud and clearAnd Bass is really Bawal 🔥🔥🔥I got it at ₹2299 only Value for money 💰."
"This is what I want.Bass is awesome thumpy, voice clearity is no.1, noice cancelation is ok while calling, perfectly fitted in ears n comfortable to wear."
"I am writing this review after two months of usage. This is the best product in earphones. If you are looking for some wireless, then surely go for this. Sound quality is good. Microphone is perfect."
"Sound quality is good but that touch is very sensitive, If you turn while lying down on bed and that touch make any contact with surface either call will disconnect or earphone shutdown and that is very annoying"
Phones are good and nice sound quality and fits in ears. Absolute no if you are looking for a noise cancelling earbuds; which makes it useless. Pretty costly for a music only earbud :(
Good but call quality is very bad. Because mic does not work properly. Other person is not able to hear us properly.
The parts are detaching in my ear itself with normal use. It's dangerous and might be fatal if not detected in time.
I m not satisfied with the product bcoz I have ordered 1st time and received on time but after 3 days of using its suddenly got stopped working so raised a refund and replace but another one that I received as replacement it's left earbud was not working so After checked raised return and refund on same day
"I decided to buy it even though the low reviews say the product is not worth it thinking they might be not true. I got my order the next day but the earphones are horrible. Distorted sounds are everywhere, the sound clarity is bad. I refunded the product immediately."
"If you want to connect these buds with a mobile device, then check your mobile has dual audio support. Otherwise, only one bud at a time is work. My Samsung A70 is working fine with these buds but Mi 11X is not working properly because Mi does not support dual audio."
"The product is worth for money. I purchased it, the delivery is delayed by amazon but the product at this range is awesome. The bass and sound is of premium quality and noise cancelation is also fair enough. Overall, it is value for money product..."
"One issue that i hqve observed though,When i connect them to my phone and I am not using them then they keeps disconnecting and reconnecting again and again ,Idont why this happens,but when I start using them again, then connection remains ,but only if when i am using them"
"Plz think of something better, ear starts paining after 15-20 mins of use, pathetic calling experience (person can hear our background voice than ours), no noise cancellation features, too sensitive touch, lags Operations..Not a bud to go with..Only product replace option available, bear it till u have."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This company has forod company because product not working properly.This company gives 1 year manufacturer warranty  but company has not received complain, this company forod me"
Due to power issues for the one the Ear Buds created Ticket on April 14 and after few dates its showing in system that its picked from my side for servicing  .... ( no one didn't picked product from my end ) …after updating multiple times with customer care ....they don't even care …. their  customer care and process ...sucks .... better choose good players from market.
"I am writing after 1 week of usage and believe me these are the best and too good  for evrything i.e. music, meetings, calling and battery back up.Just go for this whithout thinking and waiting."
Before purchasing earbuds I searched a lot about this and I got this product and I am using this from last one yearI am really satisfied with the results
It is oversized and getting ear pain even though changed the optional buds..and sound clarity is not upto the mark... Not worth for two thousand range....
This a review after 2 days it is super good and sweat proof it is really nice for songs and calls and games plus more it is the best and every penny is has value for this product love it best airdropped ever and in love with is
"Not a super quality  audio, but can't expect  much at this price.So ideal on pocket and regular  use.Note that if u need audiophile quality  audio please  shell out more money."
It's really useful in work from home as we always intend to do multiple jobs at same time;) I really like this earpods.
"I really liked the product, but the mic of this bud is not that good over a call..... the other person can't even hear a single word out of your mouth. Not a good choice if only taking for making and receiving calls.... Listening music you'll experience different world all together. The battery backup is as per say."
Worked well for 1year. After 1year the left side bud got damaged😒.It also produce heat  in high amount. I bought it with lot of expectations 😪. But!!!
So basically I wanted something fashionable so I seen this and I must say that the bass and quality are superbIf ur looking for something like this it is the best recommendation I as a customer can give.
Overall not an impressive product. Multiple instruments cannot be paired. The microphone does not pick up voices easily. You'll have to talk louder. Battery drains very fast. The only advantage is it is easy to carry.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Looks classy....sound quality good... little bit problem in ear fit..it may fall down easily...at present it is working good .let me check in future."
"My review for Airdopes 441I bought it at 1799 republic day saleBass :10/10Sound quality 10/10Build quality and battery 8/10But i returned this product Because there is no Noise cancelation, other person on a call can hear every single detail of environment but not my voice.The major draw back 😕"
"This one is not safe to use in ear.Because cannot hold properly, jumping out and missing  or getting damage easily."
"Need to be used carefully after checking all instructions. Every option has its unique purpose.Cons observed:1)When Signal strength is weak, Voice disturbances in calls over data2) Too much touch sensitivity"
"I used many more product of boat and Jbl but this was my best experience ever.....sound quality and bass quality is awesome.... I would like to recommend all of you , it you have made up your mind to buy it ;"
Sound quality was good mostly I liked the way it suited my ears after hours of long hearing it was not aching my ears but not satisfied with google assistant since it was not working battery backup was good tried by watching a movie 2hr long and sound quality was good disliked only for google assistant rest was good altogether..
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 One of the earpodes is not getting charged. After using for few days one of the eardopes stopped working and when i chargef it was not charging. It is really frustrating.i have used hardly used these 4 to 5 times.It is reaaly frustrating.please either exchange or refund."
Worth in this price range of 1500rs for music. But left earbud stopped working after 5month usage. And battery backup comes hardly an hour for right earbud. Frequently disconnects during calls.Not ideal for calls but better for music in 1500 rupees.
Sound is awesome though the bass is a bit less but still good ear-buds for the price. Would recommend buying them.
"The case wouldn't charge one of the ear piece, I don't know whether the problem lies with the case or the buds. Nevertheless, in my opinion, I don't think it would last longer than ½ year."
"When the airdopes are connected, during calls on full wifi, the airdopes do not work and create distortions. A more expensive version might solve but this one surely doesn't. Please do not buy!"
"I bought this in September but now in December after 3 months its left ear piece drains its battery in 10 minutes when its fully charged … and guess what my return window is closed , pls kindly i request you boat guys if anything can be done to replace , please kindly look into this matter # aman guta"
"The product was great when I recieved it first, then after 2 days the airdopes sounded very very low. I thought it was a defective product and replaced with new one. The replaced airdopes sounded good for 15 days and now this is also sounding very very low. This product from boat is not reliable. Worst product I've ever bought from Amazon!"
In this price couldn't ask for more. And sound quality is better than decent. Good purchase
"Pros:1. Remins intact on your ears, no risk of falling down.2. Connectivity is great with any device3. Charges pretty fastCons:1. Lot of noise comes from the left EarPods if you are not playing anything. In con call when you are alone speaking if others are on mute this noise gets really annoying!!2. Battery discharge very fast if you are on voice call3. Sound is okish"
"Although boat claims that it manufacturers it's products in India, it isn't the case as you can see in the image. It's made in P.R.C - People's republic of China.This is so not acceptable."
Thease are too good nd awesome bass to listen the music..but i has 2 minus point when we call to other they cant here our voice properly ..nd another point  these ear pods are not fit in ears properly.where they fall down we dont know... according to the music nd sound its too good...charging also soo best...
"This is an amazing product.... Worth for money Wat we pay.i would recommend this buds for people who use for gaming, present trend online classes or general purposes. The touch is modified and that made the buds more user friendly. It has super bass and noice cancellation."
This product has connectivity issues. I have Samsung 31 and 31S model mobile. When trying to connect only one side headset will connect. Other side will not connect. After sometime it will connect. Not a reliable product to purchase.
These airdopes are just not comfortable. They keep falling out . And when you return it finally after the replacement there are lots of service issues from the side of Amazon and you can in no way rely on getting a refund as they would keep telling you that the seller hasn't received the item. PLS DON'T BUY THEM .
"The Three stars are only for the sound else the product I got was defective with it's right touch sensor not working , then I ordered a replacement and then still I got a defective one as its microphone was not working and the touch sensor is still problematic .Only reason I didn't return it is its sound quality !"
"Does not properly fit in ears, bad build quality and you just can't wear these eardops for more than half an hour."
"Extreme bass booster.The Boat aidopes 441 pro provides a balanced sound with booming bass. The bass of this airdopes is deep and punchy. The music of earbuds is also loud.The audio quality of these earpods are clear, even at high volume levels. You feel the music in your ear with boosted bass"
"Right side bud stops working within a week, after a month both stops working. In the beginning after reset, they will again starts working. But now some times they stop charging..."
Overall the product is good Except noise cancellation .not good as expected. While driving there is so much of noise with the minimum speed of 20 to 30 for driving purpose don't buy this product. And also get some ear pain after using of 15 minutes 20 minutes. I think you don't need to spend that much amount on this product
After using 15 days i can say product quality is good. Though earbud will give pain constantly when use for more than a hours.Right earbud discharge 45min before left one's.  Except this music quality is good.
After replacing the 1st airdopes. After 2 week voice started breaking on calls & Now after that no voice no sound don't know what to do.Please reach me at the earliest for resolving the issue.
Pathetic noise cancellation...Only noise and JBL brands manage noise cancellation nicely... People buying for calling purposes plz dont buy.. u will regret later
Battery standby awesomeContinuously running 6 hrsSmart pairingQuick chargingOnly for calls means 3 days ( 2hours call per day).
"The first time I got the order and there was this humming sound in the left earbud. I had it replaced, the product that I have is okay.Sound quality- goodBass quality- okayNoise cancellation- somewhat only because of in ear design.Overall good wireless connectivity is not so good and doesn't not stay connected beyond 4-5 meters."
Recieve this product just today and my first impression is just horrible. Right sided Airdope not working. I raised refund request but they are replacing the product but after this I won't be able to trust Amazon. This is the worst experience I came across. I will never gonna trust Amazon in future.
"Good headphones, but the lack of noise cancellation is a major drawback making it inaudible for the call receiver to hear, while on a call (it picks up all the ambient noise, including the fan). Just use it as earphones to listen to audio and good old speakerphone for calls."
It offers a really heavy bass. Sound quality is average. Noise cancellation is too good. Battery life is outstanding. Looks are just marvellous.Many times even if I put the buds at their right position they don't charge even they don't show charging status. Many times after opening the case after 6 hours it shows still charging.  This needs to be sorted out.
Never buy this product. Poor quality. Battery on it doesn't last. Boat is a very poor quality product
"I love everything of the earpods, the only reason for giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is the way it fits in the ear. The structure good have been made to fit better in the ear.Thanks!"
"One airpod is not responding i even made factory reset but even then response.i made two types for factory reset by tripe tape and holding for 7 seconds ,i am going to order again , because i love boats some time it happens"
"Really nice product. Value for money. Beautifully fitts into your ears., looks sober.  Quality is really nice. Good battery backup. Overall a nice product."
Excellent sound quality....Bass .....simply superb 😍😍😍....eligant design..best choice at this price.... BUT ONLY DRAWBACK IS NOT GOOD FOR CALLING. when you are on call ...outsides sounds dominate your voice. Other person can't listen your voice clearly. Very much noise
Not bad but not worth money no voice cancellation option working
I m always be happy with Amazon delivery in my area. I m giving my review for this product after using 1 year. Its sound quality and battery life is still the same as it was in the beginning. No connectivity problem.I m happy with this product. It's good for purchasing....
"After 10 days of use, I can say that touch is not responsive as earlier, Notice cancellation is good, sound quality is good. People with small ear will find it uncomfortable as after sometime it starts to give slight pain. Overall I can say quality of product is not good enough so 2 star."
Best earbuds I have ever used...only draw back is calling while outdoor... microphone seems doesn't differentiate between noise and voice
I have used it for more than 2 weeksPros :Best sound qualityNoise cancellationDecent battery capacityFit to ear lightweightCTC multi-functionsWnP technology Cons:Latency in GamingSometimes one earbud will loose it's BT connectivity
"I've compared many tws earbuds and I can tell u the sound quality of this one is really good,but this is not for people who uses tws for calls, mic quality is really poor"
"Excellent product battery life is awesome, looks Dope. Although it's a great product but after like 1 hour or so you will have to take it off from your ears to avoid uneasiness."
"Noise cancellation very poor, too much white noise while on call, other party can't listen if I speak at lower intensity.Cause earache if kept for half an hour at a stretch."
Have bought the product with minimum expectations of utilising this for taking the calls.But it's a complete disaster.Noice cancellation is very bad.Not at all satisfied with the product.Its more a 500 rupees product rather than 2k.I would not suggest to buy this if someone wants to utilise for talking via these dopes.
"Best  TW earphones under 4K,  Power  COnsumption is also very good , on a single charge  i got 10-15 hrs of playtime.  By Looks Yellow color  looks good.  The only draw back is thee ear phones will not give you a  jhan jhan voice , just like in sony earphone s"
Have problem in right buds.. sometimes it not working properly!! I want to exchange is there is any warranty??
I thought it will get a good sound quality experience but as per the price it's not up to the mark. Sometimes it's get disconnected automatically. It's won't fit to the ear properly. Call quality is bad. Just one thing is very good it's touch quality.
Nice buds.Sound quality is good .And bass is parfect. Calling good. its all my opinion isBest earbuds in this price range .Lekin mujhe abhi use karte hue one day hua hai.Baaki baad me dekhte kya hota hai .Its all ok.thumsup👍👍👍
"I have purchased boAt Airdopes 441 TWS Ear-Buds with IWP Technology on 25 Oct 2020 and thereafter I have not used Airdopes bcoz of my busy schedule. In recent days when I tried to use these Airdopes, these Airdopes are not getting charged and are not working. It is requested to suggest a proper solution from the seller or from manufacturer."
Everything about this product is good except the battery.  One bud gets discharged in an hour or so of use and it hurts. Returning
pls don't buy.. first day it was good and 2nd day stardated giving trobles..one of ear bud got Dead in 5 days and return policy does not allow us ..it is afake product and not worth for buying even Rs100/- pls never buy this product ..
"Quick connection to the last device it paired with. Doesn’t hassle you with pushing buttons to turn on. Audio clear, noise cancelling is good.Con : feel like suction cups in the ear (for me they do)"
"Amazon in all circumstances ..sound , build quality but call Quality all perfect ..I'm happy to have it but less bluetooth connectivity."
Got this product delived on the same day. Boat always surprises me with their product.Very good sound quality and product is also as  displayed in images.Product quality: 5/5Sound quality: 5/5Bluetooth pairing experience: 5/5Delivery experience: 5/5
I loved this product more i like the color of the airpods it was so cute and the sound quality is verry nice this is an amazing product fro Amazon i love the way they have packed ❤And they have maintained the product very well I would wish Amazon is the number 1 shopping website
Best quality product for the price ! Nothing can beat it at this price ! In earphones list ! It’s the best !
"This is the second purchase of the product and am loving it... The sound quality, in ear comfort, call quality in all apps and phone calling, the design, the battery backup... Worth my every hard earned penny.... :) btw I do have a bose sport earbuds... But the boat is such hands on in terms of ease of use.... Just could have been a little bit sturdier."
"This device shaves off atleast 50% of the sound waves, leaving you feeling deprived. On top of this it's Made in CHINA.."
Best qualityEasy to useGood chg capacityButVery sensitive sensorPlug in ears with care
"After one hr it's quickly discharging, getting little pain inside ear, better avoid and go with with wire ear phones for safe side. but want to go with low cost in market this is the best price."
Very good product. It's sound quality is very good. It can play 4-5 hours without any problems after full change
Airdopes are good but  company telling the buds battery life is upto 5 hrs but it gives only of 2-2.5 hrs not more than that it's not good.I have used both buds individually and it gives me the battery life of 2-2.5 hrs if we use both buds together than i don't think so it gives more than of 3 hrs battery life
Product are very good..but I didn't get extra shark fin tips with this while others do..and I face comfort issue in ear..for long use I get pain and one ear tws I have to adjust multiple times otherwise it get fall of its own
"Average product. Ordered this one especially for office meetings in WFH setup. But while using this, others couldn't hear my voice properly. Only useful for listening to music. Battery backup is also not that great."
The microphone in this is useless. No one is able to hear what you speak when on call. They are only good as wireless earphones and not at all a satisfactory product for taking or making calls or attending online meetings
Its good for listening to music but when it comes to taking calls it fails miserably. The person on the other side can hardly listen to you and after about 10 mins into a call even the audio gets garbled. If possible i would return this and take one with a wire
"Amazing sound and quality of product.. power bank is also good.. no need to charge ur airdobes, only put it in case after use.. 2 week charging available.. also other device charging option is amazing!"
Its pretty cool.. only problem is that u have to reset it pretty often n keep the volume high for better experience... but overall great its been more than a month m using this product. N m loving it.
These boAt Airdopes are awesome. I these are the one of the best Airdopes I seen l. Sound quality was awesome. Bass quality is extremely fantastic. Charging is also very fast. Really it's noise cancellation is awesome. I think this was the best choice I brought.
"Everything is ok but there is always a crackling sound in left one , whenever I stop any song or any video ... and when I increase the volume the cracking sound I cant hear , but when I decrease the sound to the lowest level , that annoying crackling sound only in left eardopes it's really bad , rest every thing is really amazing I liked it ..."
"Decent Earbuds.Dont expect much bass from this earphone.This is not suitable for those who plan to use this while riding. One side gets disconnected when you wear helmet.And there is always this mild static noise in the left earbud, which fades away when songs are played.Battery backup is nice.No dedicated noise cancellation features. Change the eartip accordingly to get the perfect seal for noise reduction."
Just brilliant sound clarity. I was skeptical about mic being far from mouth but it doesn't cause any noise issues. Next day delivered. Controls are different and does not have any buttons. Could new difficult to manage in the beginning.
"Fitting is a little lose, it drops while you’re travel even with the smallest size of the ear plug.Overall the built quality and sound quality is more than worth the price. It looks quite premium and the battery lasts really long."
"It fits into ears nicely, can't come out on its own.  Has a beautiful output.  Links with mobile quite quickly."
"Very good initial impressions. Received them quickly from Amazon, got paired quickly without hassles to the phone, and I was in music heaven before I knew it. Kudos to boAt. Making Indians proud"
Everything is fine but the ears buds will ran out of charge within 3.5 to 4 hours. Charging case is really working great.If you want to attend online classes continuously from morning to evening then better don't buy. If u are a normal user then it would be a good option to buy
"Terrible Microphone. Decent audio quality. It was painful to wear just in 2 days use because of the design. If you are looking to attend meetings with this, it's bad choice. Product that got delivered first and replacement had issues."
This is amazing eardops sound quality is awesome bass is also good I will 5out of 5 star for sound but notice cancelation is not good or not bad it's average I'll give 5 out 3 star for noise cancelation you can buy this eardops it's amazing.
Boat is the bestum best product i have so many products of boat recently i purchased this boat airdopes its sound was so awesome and base also.
Everything was good about the product. But when it arrived it look liked used by someone as box was already opened. Yet as trusted customer of Amazon I had shot and decided to use them. But there was no fault until today (just after return policy expired) .  Now left earbud is not working as expected. I getting off automatically.
"WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER ORDERED IN AMAZON.I ordered this Boat Airdopes 441 on 15Nov-20 and got delivered it by 17Nov-20.As soon as i got the package i connected it with my iphone and felt very disappointed to hear the audio quality.Even at full volume i could barely hear 50% sound.Please never buy this product Total Waste of money.Edit:After listening for 5 minutes,right airpod stopped working.This is such a scam"
Using it for past two months. It was so good at the first time of usage. After one month of usage left airpod was not working properly. It gets heating and giving high noise with low sound.Now i have sent to boat service centre for claiming warranty. Hope they will rectify the problem.But the good thing was right airpod was so good.
Good quality airpods the sound is amazing in this price segment. The bass is very good ears will shake like anything. Battery pack is also nice. Crystal clear sound. But mic is too while talking in call other person can't hear clearly this is only the disadvantage. But over all the airpods are great.
"Honestly, i am really impresed with with product very nice clearity but extreme bass which is okay if anyone looking for good base . The charging case is also looking very sleek and gives you a premium look . But the touch is so sensitive if you adjusting and touch it that will disconnect the call .."
"Sound quality is pretty bad , I don't why reviews are so hyped . And there no bass at all ... So for music lovers it's a BIG NO"
"Sound is too low, bass is good, too uncomfortable to use bec of its fins, another cons: no indication of % on case, its really imp, battery: 3 from 5, overall fuddu hai , desi hai full, boat have a good brand impression but trust me quality similar protronics wecool , no need to spend more money"
"These head phones are completely worthless, it has very low sensitivity to voice during calls.For music stuff, it has great bass, but for calls, meetings, these are useless"
Good product !!But has difficulty in connection while on bike !! It keeps connecting and disconnect !!Sound quality is not best but good for an houre full of songs listen.Not recommended for in call use !!
It has good sound quality and very good battery life....also earphone didn't fall off their own while jogging or dancing....but it's rubber corners might hurt to people with small ear size.
Have been using the product for nearly a month. I am satisfied with sound quality though it is not so loud. Touch works nively. I am not happy with the range of the BT. It disconnects even if u go beyond 5 mtrs. You move lil bit out of range and it disconnects. Rest it's a good TWS for listening to audios and music and calls.
"It has lot of connectivity issues, specially with my iPhone n macbook pro. Even after replacement, I had same issues. Finally returning it back. 3 star for sound quality. Can be used for listening music. But recommended for taking calls."
Everything is amazing except one thing which is Mic quality.Mic quality is the worst out of all. The voice cuts after few seconds.I had no such issue with my Rs.899 pTron Bassbuds so I thought this will be bit better but this is the worst!If you want to buy it just for Music listening then go for it.
Mere wife ne gift Diya tha . Maine. 19March ko use Kiya.  Left side ke spiker aavaj nahi deta . Mai to fas gya aur to aur uper se return window bhi band ho gai .

 Excellent product.. love it.. Best sound quality.. it's worth.."
"It is not a good product where you can invest your 2000 rs. I am telling you this after using it for 2 months. There are lot of other better earbuds at lesser price, don't go by brand or any YouTube video because I did the same. Money is yours, so choice is yours."
"--------------------------------------------------Amazing product !!! But not comfortable for long time for ears, superb bass , amazing sound quality must buy it.--------------------------------------------------"
Extra product with our order things are Colgate toothpaste and lotus herbals neemwash my order is of boat air  dopes 441 but we get these two things extra in box. but the sound quality is too good
Too much uncontrollable bass. For gaming very bad. Latency is very annoying while gaming. Good for looks and battery quality.
"One side stopped working after only a month of light usage. On top of that, there's a slight delay in transmission while watching movies and such, which throws the whole soundtrack out of sync. And then there's no direct way of knowing how much battery is left. Not recommended."
Love everything about them.. Sound quality.. Battery  backup.. Fitting in the ear. Value for money. This is my 2nd product from Boat and i am totally impressed by the brand!
The Best TWS right now in the market. Bought for 2000₹. Perfect Audio Quality for daily Use. Has fins so doesnt fall while running.
"It has good sound quality and looks super cute. Bass and noise cancellation is also nice. Touch is very sensitive sometimes create problem, for instance  if you are lying in sideways and by mistake your arm will touch the airdop music gets stop. Although it is really very product by boat."
its perfect..if sound decrease and increase option available in that case it would be awesome.
"Best sound quality, bass, amazing battery back up.I really enjoyed my movies and series with these buds But they seem to be not suitable for gaming as i noticed latency while playing BGMI. Overall the product is really good.PS: I don't mind wearing my Boat bass heads wired headphones for  gaming😉"
It’s an average product. Sometimes it has connectivity issues also... off and on... overall sound quality is ok looking at the price.
"I am writing the review for the first time for boat products. After using month, the earbuds having constant glitches even though the mobile or laptop is very close to the buds. Never expected such low quality products from the boat. For the first time I'm regret myself for buying this airdopes"
My husband gifted me and I m so in love with themGood noise cancellationGood bassBest sound qualityThank you Amazon for the delivery
"Truly wireless experience. Unstoppable battery. Immersive Sound.Plug into the most seamless workouts with these true wireless earbuds designed for sweat, splash, and water resistance. The perfect Secure Fit for outdoors with advanced capacitive touch controls to power your non stop hustle. Hit the gym or play on the field, these earbuds remain intact."
Sound quality is very good. Noise cancellation is even better
very good sound and even better battery. lasts very long. total VFM package
King among the budget friendly airdropes... And upgraded version of boat 441Heavy bassCrystal clear soundA better battery lifeSolid caseImproved Water and splash resistance
"frequent recharge required. coverage distance is not even 4 meters. Even after prolonged charge, one ear piece shows charge is incomplete. Audio time lag exist when you watch video.Do not waste your money.."
I’m using this product.My experience this product is excellent. Minimum price is excellent product in available . You can buy this product and enjoy with sound and bass good
"FIT - This was a good purchase for me, since it provides comfortable grip for in -ear comfort. It hardly falls down. I wear it during rush hours in trains.SOUND - GOOD CLARITY AND NOISE CANCELLATION. BASS IS MODERATE.CONNECTIVITY - CONNECTS IN SECONDS.OVERALL DESERVES 4 STARS."
Sound quality is satisfactory other than that it is a good product for the price.Battery is not at all withstanding as per description. Especially the case is not even charging the airdopes for 2 full charges even.
The product is really good.But the design of the equipment is truly very bad. Doesn't stick to the ear keeps calling off.
"They are pretty decent when it comes to just listening to music for a short while. The pairing process is quick and easy. But call quality is extremely poor. For prolonged usage, it gets extremely painful if your ears are small. It doesn’t come with different sized buds."
"Really dissapointed with the product.Look wise its up to the mark.Gets fully charged within an hour.But the Bluetooth gets disconnected frequently.. Again and again... Not very satisfied with the performance. I requested for a replacement, but again its the same problem"
The earphone is dead in just 3 months of very less usage.. Max playtime in the whole 3 month would be around 30-40 hours.. Not suggesting this device.. I can even give my contact number if you need more details
Writing this review after one month of usage.. Fully satisfied with this product nice base and sound quality.. Bluetooth connectivity lightening speed good battery backup.. Worth for your money and Go for it...
Great till now
"Sound quality is pretty satisfactory,  but if you are music lover can try something else, but if are an average user, it's perfect.I think you can't put any ear bud for long into your ear, its becomes irritating and painful."
"Keeps getting disconnected if I move to the next room and i have to put it back in the case, open and close it to reconnect to my Laptop. Similarly one earphone keeps getting disconnected if i remove them from my ear and leave it out for just a few seconds. So other than connectivity issues the Earphones have good sound quality and are quite comfortable."
I am writing this review after 1 year use.1) product built  is awesome its not like cheap produt that is break after few months or break by simple drop/ fall.2) about sound -  awesome.Totally balanced3) noice cancellation is better not best
"Sound quality is alright, but it discharges while charging ….. not a very reliable product. Wouldn’t recommend."
"Sound quality is very nice,Bass is up to mark, little loud, loudness shoud be controlled, in higher volume can't listen more then 2 songs."
"Poor Bass Quality, poor design, When using it after charging, the Buds remains Heated, because of charging the case. even without charging the case through Charger, The buds remains Heated. Also After using of 3 hours , Charge gets low. Cannot use properly. Have to care more, full tension, Bad product though."
"The quality is mediocre. The headset does not connect with two separate mobiles. Within 6 months of use left ear bud stopped working. After warranty claim, the left ear but works but the battery drain within one hr and I have to listen with only the right bud. Waste of money. Not worth buying."
Sound quality ok.Product fit hopeless. Ears start to pain after use. Tried with smaller size rubber attachment but still the same.I would not recommend for purchase .Given an option I would return the product.Not satisfied at all and bad comfort level.
"Right earbud has some issues since the first time I opened box, it connects and disconnects automatically. Again I have to put it in box and take it out same happens again and again.Will check out for 3-4 days or else try to return the product.Other than this issue, every thing else is A1, Excellent."
"Very good product but i am unable to use it. When it is in my ear, i am totally deaf. I can't hear anything. Sometimes connectivity issues"
sound quality awesome.But buttons are too active will easily pause a video even if you are attempting to adjust the phones.Microphone is available in only right earbud.If right is lost left ear bud will not work or connect to Bluetooth.Call quality can be improved currently reasonable
Very bad quality headset Bluetooth range very less gets disconnected very easily  and charge gets drained for right earpiece faster and does not last more that 2 hrs. It could be for my earphone but I tried replacing and the replacement piece had the same issue.
"Couldn't able to hear continuous for an hour , there is some inbuilt noise Heard suddenly, I had to reset every 30mins. Not a mind blower.Charging back up is good. Otherwise too expensive for device with gletich."
"Worst product of boAt so far,1- Voice on call doesn’t work properly the other person can’t hear you properly.2- Handling is very poor if you kind of trying to relax and trying to keep your head down to your hand it will pause due to touch or de attach the device.Very poor experience"
After using this airdrop for 4 months now it just makes me so frustrated 1st the problem was only one eardrop will connect although that was only sometimes.. now the audio or music what ever i play it just gets mute for some second and then plays again then gets mute... Frankly this is a very worst product
"Does not connect properly and can't answer calls and have to disconnect it and reconnect it again to make it work properly. Also the battery backup is of no use sometimes after full charge i use it for 15 mins and battery is drained , it like old model battery phones sometimes full charged sometimes dead ."
Just one thing......its awesome.....i usually use them as an intercom in my helmet....and it just works awesome.....but be careful using them....they might come off
The left ear bud produces some kind of a continuous whirring sound that is very irritating. I thought that my unit is faulty and got it replaced by amazon which turned out to be a big waste of time as the replacement sounds worse than the first one and more whirring sound.
Great Bass👌☑️ Super Build Quality☑️Light Weight &Compatable Charging Case*
"Sound quality good ,noise cancellation good and battery power is awesome earbuds usually lasts for 4-5 hours after fully charge and approximately 120 hours of case battery.Not good for longer use like 2-3 hours,not comfortable and range of connectivity is very poor not more than 7-8 meters. You have to keep phone with you otherwise it will disconnect."
I have been looking for the good earbuds for long and with this I got the best one. Best earbuds in this range. You won't regret having this
"The mic is horrible, people on the other side find it difficult to hear you. Sound quality is fine for the amount but mic quality could have been better as compared the cheapest of the earpods available in market."
"Bass and sound quality is excellent.3.5 hrs playback and 15 hrs with case.Fitting is very good, don't come out of ears while running.Best in quality overall."
Sound quality is quite good. Noise cancellation is not up to the mark. Others can hear background noises while on call. Battery backup is excellent. Not a bass lover so I am satisfied with the bass provided. Good deal for a decent price. If priority is sound quality and battery backup would recommend this.
I will strongly suggest you to for another product as I found this noise issue with the left bud and ordered a replacement. Problem persisted even with the replacement and I decided ro return them. Boat is amazing with their branding but this product is a total failure. I went through all the reviews and then decided to purchase them but it was a disaster for me. Look for a better option.
"Nice delivery service, product quality is very good,and product packaging very nice , value for money, nice product battery backup so good"
Good quality of sound but it is useless if your voice keeps breaking. I bought these on 6 Aug and got it delivered on 13 Aug and I started facing problem after 13 days of use. I can't return these. They are bad.
"Product quality is very good.. case is soo cute, i was in a dilemma while selecting the design but then i felt i made a right decision by selecting black star.. case is soo cute..😍 and working quality of earbuds is very good, best to listen songs...✌️"
"Plz  don't buy  such a pathetic product.After one week of use  it's not working properly,  even difficulties in pairing with phone. Poor quality  in calling  sometime  call disconnect itself.Customer service is also not responding.Avoid to buy."
"I usally don't review. But this product is not worth to buy I realised after 1-2 month use. You feel pain in ear while using after 30 min. It drops from ear frequently. No noise cancellation support.Mic is worst, your voice will go very low from mic"
"Music 💯 good 👌(Near by SONY Xb 400), but call quality too bad....."
"I tried it for almost more than month ...its really an amazing product at afordable price ..its budget friendly ....quality ,speaker and microphone all are good .I brought it in neon colour n i love it"
"Its super cool....with smooth and effective bass.....reasonable treble, but the only draw back is...the powered case is only 500mah which is pretty hard to maintain on a daily basis, and the mic is not at its peak quality, you won't be able to use it outdoor.....apart from that...everything is perfect👍👍"
It is worst money because lot of environment disturbance during calls u can't communicate with this productAnd the customer support is not give proper response to customer's and if u hard to reached the customer service there are replace ur product with second hand used product
not great. dont waste money
"Brought this 2 weeks back and now stopped working.. warranty is there, so I called them and they told it will take around 24 days to rectify the whole warranty matters.. also the battery backup is getting around 3.5hrs to 4hrs only.. will see whether my problem gets solved"
"Product is OK OK not bad not good bass quality great but calling not good you can't talk with that your voice is not clear when you use for calling it's is also not fit in the ear They fall down when I run or do some workout,  for music purpose it's great and bettery only work 3 hrs single charge and  with case 30 hrs."
sound quality is awesome quick connectivity with my S10+ battery back up is also very good and water resistant is also good perfectly fit on ear . and most important thing that it gives you a powerful power bank for emergency charging option which is used often.i am a happy customer of boat product.
"While inserting in ear, i feel small discomfort while listening to music. Small pain occuring after 10 to 15 minutes of playing music or speaking on call. Otherwise the sound quality and base quality is excellent...."
"I got these airdopes from Amazon, everytime I pluuged it into my ears, either of the sides would work and the other one won't. Since it was under warranty, I could file fora replacement with Boat manufacturers and got it replaced and the new ones are working greatn"
After 2 months of usage the airdrops have been rendered useless in terms of bluetooth connectivity. No point of using them with either smartphone or laptop. I hope boAt sees this review and improves their quality and not just give products at competitive prices for the sake of market capture
"While using these during a call, experienced bad communication. The other person is unable to hear properly when connected to boat airdopes"
The boat earpods are very good they look cool on your ears and night ...but there is one disadvantage that is if you are using the earbuds for a long time on your ears your ears will start paining ..😥if you are a song addicted then do not use this earpods and if you do not use that much then you can buy
Super product I love boat I feel boat effects mind blowing awesome earbuds Rs.2499I will received in Amazon prime time offer sale but this is Rs.3499 but worthy1.sound 4.5/52.bass 4.5/53.battery 5/54.quality 5/55.comfortable 5/56.connectivity 5/5Overall this is best earbuds.
Really a great product. Open and play.Batter last approximately 10 hrs in single charge....fast delivery by Amazon
"I used one week and loved.. but I returned it because it’s not fitted properly in my ears, even the small buds also! and also have irritation while talking.. Powerful mic is catching surrounding sound also.."
"Do not buy this product. I brought two of them, one for me and one for my wife. Both failed to charge exactly 1 year after purchase. The box is defective and I can't even claim waranty now! I have been duped"
Just woww yrrr..... favourite order and earpods ever❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️best of the bestest sound ever...m loving it🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️🤍🤍🤍 thnkew amazon and thnkew boat❤️❤️❤️❤️ sound quality is just like u are in heaven... noise cancellation is too much great...bass quality is great of the greatest
"The sound quality is amazing and the bass is also pretty good .....but they are not comfortable .....in a lo g run if u are using them for gym ,cardio or only for listing music after 25-30 your ear will start to pain cause of the rubber fittings as they are not so soft and will leave a red mark in your ear . Only buy them if the deal is of about ₹1800-₹1900."
Product wasgood.But the delivery service were horrible. He was talking to me like i was something doing wrong. Ithink such problems arises ony for prepaid products. Anyway very poor behaviour from dliveryboy
"Sound quality ,noise cancellation is good and the bass is also loud but after 3 days of using what I found is:1. Connecting issues occur.....either one of the sides connect2. Charge does not hold that much3. The touch sensors sometimes don't respond"
Best value of money does not have noise cancellation the base is better than the old Samsung Galaxy buds sound qualities is awesome I think it is the best of boat
Not as I expected... Overall sound quality is OK but bass is not tight and feel like spreading bass. And what are functions given in user manul are not matching with the earphones and totally different.
"Nice value for money product.Especially an Indian product(though it's made in China, in the end money goes to Indian company)When we have such a quality & value for money products, I believe we don't need to encourage products from enemy nations."
"Within 10 days of using the product, one of the airdopes, keeps disconnecting from the pair. Unfortunately replacement time has elapsed, hence waiting to repair under warranty.. But really  disappointed, as i expected to have a good experience considering the brand and the cost."
not so goodWhat ur listening is also listened by other persons who are sitting besides you very easily.... bass are ok but volume जो bhar जाता है सब सुन सकते h कोई privacy nh h
Best sound quality at this range and of course at boAt standards amazing product🙂😊. But if anyone's looking to buy this for gaming then let me inform it only has latency issue with the gaming part only rest all about this product is literally top class😌!
It is a fantastic ear buds with excellent sound quality at this price. Even i have experienced the same quality in Bose ear buds.Giving 5 star.
Best product in this price range i got it for 1999 only during sale. Best for music and gaming but for calls it's average!!!
These were delivered to me on 2nd dec 21...and right airdope has stopped working in 1.5 month...there is no exchange available...also they are bit uncorfotable when plugged in ears...they dont fit properly in ears and come out while using...didt expected such quality from Boat
"Product is fine and it will work max 15 to 20 days fine but after that you will face connectivity issues. Personal experience, one side is stop working but started working fineSomething facing glitch in connectionBattery backup is fineAll over better to avoid"
I purchased a few months back and its a value for money product only one hiccup is that sometimes it responds a bot late.
"It's a really good product but it doesn't support door step services n the sensor of one ear was not working in first 10 days  n it was after 10 days I couldn't order my replacement through Amazon , I had to go to service center but it was close and no one answer the pH of that service center in Thane . I really like that product but disappointed by the service"
Amazing product. Totally loved itThe sound quality is amazing and one can easily enjoy the music. It definitely works perfect!
Mine Stopped Working just after 10 days replacement window. now it nothing more than magnetic toy.I would personally never recommend Boat Headphones
Very poor quality sound.....very very disappointed. And amzon is not return policy of electronic products... So please book before 100times check the policy otherwise retail store is good to check then take the product.
"There's only one demerit of this, i.e background noise is more rather than our voice during calls."
When i buy this product i got second hand (Prebuyed or replced)  products. I returned it and rebuy it after using some time i am satisfied with sound quality but it is not comfortable whe you use it gor 1-2 houres continually it really pains in my ear and when you don't use it left airpod makes kind of annoying noice like some kind of distortion.... I think you should rethink before buying it...
It fit perfect in my ears.The sound quality is fine ..But when you watch full movie for the 1st time with this aripods there wil be some pain in ears ..when you remove your headset .
The sound and base quality is like average. But the main problem is with the noise cancelation. I alws hear a buzz sound in right earphone. I orderd an replacement it also have the same buzzing problem
"The sound gets distorted at max volume. Recommended to put the volume on 70 percent or less for better experience. The noise cancellation is good(okayish) but could have been better. Bass quality is pretty good and yes that's when the volume is below 80 percent or so. Connectivity vise, its impressive. Battery is also good but not that great. Fit in the ear is amazing."
It can be used while running/jogging easily. Sound quality is excellent. Only con is its noise cancellation. It can't be used while attending meetings.
"Worst product , plzz don't waste ur money on this product , for first 20 days it was working properly and then suddenly the sound of left earbud got reduced and it finally stopped working , when i replaced it under warranty the same problem occurred now the touch is not working, I replaced it for 2 times , I really wasted my money"
"Sound are not good, bass are dull, not for worth money, bad experience with the high costNot satisfied my needOn-call double voice are be generated from another end of the call"
Sound quality is good but fitting is a issue. Can't wear for long time it hurts
I bought this mainly for workout. So I don't care about call quality or battery. I expect good fit in ear. It fullfiilled that need.
It’s awesome product delivered by Amazon it’s about 2 months and it’s working for me on single charge. Sound quality is awesome. There is one flaw which I have observed is the ear pad size it’s not fit and after some time you feel Pain..
Very good sound and bass. Good for learning any song lyrics. They catches pin drop voice. Really they gave me crystal clear sound. Thanks to boAt they fulfill his commitment about sound and airdops quality.
Very light and effective for jogging and workout.
"The product is quite adequate but there is a unusual sound in right airdope ,for a few second , when i stop music and its also noticeable on low volume . I don't know why that sound coming but its is there.The performance time of each earbud is 3 hours .Over all product is performing very well. And i suggest to buy it in ₹1999 ."
Totally satisfied with this product ❣️Sound quality is just OSM😍That booming bass nailed it🔥Touch sensitive button works perfectly and fast too✨Battery life is also great 👍And latency while playing Pubg is just perfect 👌Overall its a great product 🥰Go for it... 🖤
Another nice product from house of BoAt.Perfect in this price range and better than many expensive one.

 Never buy it if you just want to get battery backup than you can think of it otherwise don't buy it. I buyed it because I thought it would be better than Airdopes 441 but no.But seeing at the other angle it has a very good battery backup"
This product is only to hear music. Call quality is very poor.dont purchase it ..you can't make voice calls with Android devices.it works well with jio keypad 📱 phone
Not for calling ....we can use for gaming or videos ...battery backup is also so so
Sound Quality is simply awesome. Seller has provided original product...Amazon Thank you so much for such a fast delivery ordered at 3am got the product by 8:30am... What more can anyone ask for...!!!
Not at all worth buying the product.. it is written left and right play options play previous and next song on double click but it does not happen.. there is no dual pairing as well..
Awesome quality don't think it buy it love it. sound quality good bass quality awesome.
"Bluetooth connectivity is not good at all. Voice start cracking if you will walk from one room to another. Not upto mark as per price,I want to return it but policy didn't allow."
Very good product. I bought for my son and he accepted the product after using. His acceptance means that the product is good enough to use.
It is advised not to purchase this item...Highly unsatisfied...3 days usage review...Returning policy is not good replace with same item but what in case such item not required..No option available to return with another good items..👎👎👎👎👎
Worst productStoped working after 2-3 monthsRarely used .stopped getting connectedWaste of money and feel too heavy in ears
"Sound quality is excellent, with average noise cancellation and bass is also good. Only thing that irritating is if you are on call and by mistake if you touch the earphone then it's disconnect."
"More than expected, sound quality and battery backup awesome. I used it daily for sound meditation 🧘‍♀️ one hour. And it never fails. Value for money."
"This is a very bad product. It works properly for sometime and after all of a sudden you can't hear tue sound. The product quality is very poor in terms of manufacturing, and this is my 3 earphone and airpod from boat and every single time I was disappointed by the company with their products.  I would suggest not to go for this product ever."
Good quality but soud and battery life improvement needed. In same price range jbl airpod is much better wrt sound and battery.
I bought this airpod and it stopped working right side within one month. Finding customer service number is impossible. I tried resetting the AirPods multiple times without any luck. Waiting for customer service to respond
****For People feeling no bass or less bass ***---> Change the buds provided with box as per your ear hole size---> It should be perfect sealed vaccum you should feel with correct bud size---> Now enjoy the super BASSOnly thing volume control could have been better addition which I found missing  ( controlled only by devices)---–-------x_-----------
"An good earpods perfect fit in ears sturdy design. A good packing, about sound quality best sound quality with awesome bass booster, very good touch feature manual ON/OFF is another one best feature.Another and one of the feature I am in search of is type-C charging portOverall an quality product to buy🤩👍🏼"
Every time i buy boat products.. It will get damaged within few months . Recently I bought this one and it damaged with 6 months.. Applied waranty and product replaced.. The replaced product was also had battery issues at first and now 1 side is not even working... Go for better brands even if it's cost u higher..
After months of using this my review is :I never expected a great sound quality : they neither surprised me nor disappointed me on that.Bluetooth connectivity : Please consider adding wired connection option alongside if this bluetooth connectivity is not what you are planning to work on.
"As it is mentioned in the user manual ""2×pair ofear caps "" Didn't got any extra ear caps inside the box.The earbuds are not that comfortable . I can hardly use it for 40-45 mins without any pain ..My ears hurts if I use them for a bit longer time period.  . Rest , the build quality , sound quality, battery life, everything is fine."
"I used it for 2 months and already the primary feature - audio itself is not working.When connected with the support team, I was asked to return it but it's been 2 months and no proper response from them. Their support team is super rude. Very bad experience with Boat."
Sound quality is Ok. But huge disappointment for Calling. So iiritating. It is Disconnected lots of time automatocally during the call. In a 1 minute call it is 4 5 time disconnected atomatically. So irritating. I suggest It for gym workout or for gaming but not for calling.
After 2 days right side of ear bud is stoped working totally flop don't buy. How can any buddy believe in indian product then this is the quality
I thought by looking at the rating by Amazon it would be good.. but in the end it's below average..it sounds like placed a speaker far from your ear or kept in an empty hall or something...
I find them average. Bass sound is not as per my expectations. You cannot use it for long time. It start hurting in ear.
"This Product is so good. Must buy this product because I bought a Boult powerbuds , it automatically turned off and it doesn't works properly. But this product is massive. Especially the *Bass is very much good. Any bass lovers✨must try this product don't try other products."
"Its worth every penny, its the best, the bass is god like ,the sound quality is superb ,it has bluetooth5.0 which makes it easier to tell how much battery left as well, not just that its water proof .If your thinking don't think just buy it."
"First things first, They dont fit properly. Yes they dont, so if your ears are of medium size or small dont order them.and NO BASS . Disappointed a lil bit, but itnhas ipx7 and c type charging port."
Got this airdopes replaced twice (thanks to Amazon's service). But there is frequent interuption in playback even when I turn my head left and right (forget jogging and using it in the gym). Even when you sit still - the left earpiece disconnects frequently. This was the case in both the airdopes pieces that I got.
Good sound quality and noise cancellation for the price. However while speaking through microphone you may face challenges sometimes. Other party may not be able to hear clearly.
"First impression was that it looked and felt good and bass quality for this point of price is truly fantastic but one minor fault I found was in sound quality, due to bass it kind of feels low. The capacitive touch works as mentioned and this feature I loved most too. Well I would like to say if you are looking for ear buds at this price point, you can go for this. Way better than previous earbuds I used from crossbeats urban 2020."
Have purchased this product on November 2020 now it's been a year. I have used very Minimal and from last few months left airdope is not charging. When I put into the case it shows red light but doesn't charge. Only right airdop is working... highly recommend not to buy this product....
It is a good ear bud for all types of music lovers and Also for call good experience with these earbuds .Sound quality⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Noise cancellation⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Bass quality⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Don't ever buy this.. Worst.. I am changing my rating after 6 months of usage.. It does not connect well with phone or laptop and there will be lot of disruption in the connection.. Guess, this could be duplicate product."
I'm writing this review after 2 weeks of usage. The left earbud has stopped working. It doesn't connect. There's a lot of noise during calls and the voice is audible. The design is painful in ears. The most you can use is 30mins. Absolute waste of 2499 Rs. Please don't buy.
"Decent product, but has lot of bugs. After buying it for the first time, the right side plug stopped working and I had to get it replaced. For now it's working fine, don't know if I will have to repent later. Sound quality is fine for the price we pay, but I'm disappointed with the issues that the product has."
"Was replaced once (blue) and got a black after registering a complaint ticket in boat site.After service of boat is great.Good sound quality and bass, fits well in your ear.Note: better to use the normal charger and the cable given. Fast charger used may cause problems.Worth the money!"
"Size of the device is large enough, it causes pain in the ear pinna even after 30 min of use.Not recommended if looking for using it for longer duration."
Airdopes are good. sound quality is also good. but there is static noice in my left earbud. When i play song on low volume i continuous hear some noice and when i listen high bass songs at full volume there is some distrubance in right earbud.Have raised a replacement requested on 26th August and i got product on 29th August in second product i got same problem.and now i requested to return this product.
"This is one of the best purchase I ever did. Wonderful sound quality. I listen to my favourite tracks everyday during my evening walk, I am happy with the purchase."
It's so heartening that boat isn't giving quality in their products.. I hardly used my product for 5 to 7 times.. And yet it has no sound in left earbud.. Even they're new!!I don't expect this from boat.. Btw that's why indian made products don't get their boom in market..Trust is everything bud 🌱
One earbud doesn't work at all even after troubleshooting and reseting. Amazon technical team is not sound and doesn't know what to do. All they suggest is replacement. Even in replacement the cash back and product exchange is not possible. All one can do is keep replacing same product
Boat airdrop 441 was working well and also some issue for 441 pro. not fitted charging case and not charging well bass is good
"So I really love the product, it fits perfectly in your ear and is very comfortable to use. Sound quality is really good for a truly wireless device, as good as a wired one. My only complain is that I get to hear a slight buzzing sound on my right Airdopes when im not listening to anything, like the sound of a wireless interference. It gets kinda annoying."
"The earphones are a blessing to the ears but I got one defective as the right earpiece is making a buzzing sound and then it goes off after 4 or 5 seconds. If this happened to anyone, please mention it in the review box as well.You won't regret this purchase overall."
"Only left earbud is working, right one neither connecting together nor working even only red light is blinking, no blue light no green like in other one.Also right earbud not even working in mono mode neither in streao mode."
After buying this.I Am still using my usual earphones on jog.Cuz this keeps falling off . Then in Middle of road you have to search for it!SecondlyConsider using it in your room then after about 40..50 mins you will find ache in your ear cuz of the design.Pethatic!Regret buying.
Gifted this to my sister in law and she uses them everyday. She loves them. Very useful product. Great quality. Value for money and better noise masking from outside sounds. Overall great product
Good product... And battery life is good
I have been using this for more than one year right side air bus show problem after 6 months based on it I used my warranty period privilege but even though after 1 year the problem occurs again and after 1.2 year right side is completely deadThere is no service center after warranty who take care our product
Sometimes I can make out that the two speakers are our of phase and the mic is extremely poor. People are not able to hear.
Made in China.
Sound Quality and bass is good. But voice cancellation is very poor. While on call person on other side hears voice from all around except the person he is talking to. And you have to talk lauder so that the person on the other side could hear you. Except that it has good battery backup. It connects very smoothly.
Product is nice..... Using this product for 2 months ..... Sound quality is good but bass is not upto mark. Even noise cancellation is quite impressive.... The only think I don't like is that the charging case is comparatively bigger than other airpods and a bit heavy.... But airpods are very good .
"Didn't got what I was expecting.Bass is poor.Sound quality is not upto the mark.Backup on single charge is around 3 to 3.5hrs.Calling is worst, catches surrounding sounds and even in quiet places if you speak on lower pitch people on other side can't hear much."
Boat products are very good. Very happy with the product...
"Good for those who want have a feel of using buds for starters, they do take a little time getting used to, but overall the quality in terms of packaging, product and sound delivery is good."
When it was replaced for the first time I didn't unboxed it yet and when opened it those ear buds were missing ☹️ as well as the left ear dope
"In this range, this is the best. I have purchased it after doing a lot of research as paying 3k for a product is huge. I am using it for a week now  . Fitting is great in ear, sound is good and so is its display. For calling also it works very well."
Good sound quality but a bit heavy for ears....you will start feel pain in ears after 15-20 min of use.
1. Saound quality is great2. Good for gaming footsteps are clear3. If you are a bass lover you should buy it  4. Noise cancellation is excellent5. Battery backup is also good I charged the case 4 days before and it's still full charged even I have used it a lot of times.
These airdopes stopped working after 2months I had to send it for repair and the worst part is it's been a month I've not received my replacement yet and the customer service is pathetic everytime you call you will get a same answer that it will arrive shortly.... won't order or use boat anymore
Uncomfortable for the ear. The wings are a pain to wear for a long time.Calling through it is an issue as the voice of the speaker is feeble
Not too good ..Lacks sound clarity and issue with connectivity. Want to return but no option to return.Amazon pls initiate a return request for this item
Sound quality is good and build quality is also good in this range just my ear are small and sometimes looks too big for small ears and little difficult to fit
Sound quality is great. Noise cancellation is perfect. Bass quality is good. Battery back up is also great. Comfortable to wear. Just 1 issue is you might feel little harshness if you use it for longer period like an hour. i bought it for 2499 and next day price dropped to 1999. :(
Third class company with third class product... Product didn't charge properly neither it connect..Sent for replacement ..It's been 1 month...Fraud company..Plz stay awayRefund my money
Product return chestay  thisukovatla - product work cheyatla - wastage of money don't buy this one - does not working - worst service also does not responding - irresponsible communication.Note : Waste product of the year
Sound & Battery backup is above average. Decent bass & call quality. It can be used single or in pair also. Meet Expectations. Recommended.
"The sound is quality is average but it has good bass. Oneplus z are much better than this and they are also much easy to use, sound quality is the best and also they are light weight."
"The best set of earphones around this price. If you are looking for a entry level truely wireless earphones, go for it with your eyes closed."
My daugther was looking for an inexpensive option for earpods to listen to music while jogging. boAt earpods are a great buy as sound quality is good and they're priced reasonably.
This is good product but bikers can't use this bcoz in helmet we will not able to take calls.
Frequently disconnected with phone. Painful after 30 min of use. Waste of money. Review after a month
Not so impressive......right ear pod is not working. Its just 10 days since I bought them  and return window is already closed.
"The sound quality, charging (used to last around 3 to 3.5 hours) is good. It has been around 8 months since I purchased it and my left earbud lasts only 20mins whereas right earbud lasts 3hours. Tried factory reset and other fixes suggested online but no use"
The product is shown is returned by me...they have put on the same product as when I asked for replacement they told me that they are out of stock but next day after return they were in shock....this one is a faulty product....beware ...sound of buzzing comes in left airdopes
"The product is really durable and functions effectively. The sound clarity is really crisp and the bass is decent, better than anticipated gives you the immersive experience let it be while enjoying multimedia or while gaming. Overall worth every penny invested on it..."
"Poor quality product, one of my earpod is having less than 10 minutes of battery backup, after 5 min the Sound will go low and later it will switch off"
"This is good product as expected , voice of mic is clear, incoming voice is also clear."
The ear fit is not such that you can get a hang of it easily! Or always! It can pop out! Otherwise good quality sound and decent noise reduction as  value for money!
The product came in 2 days from the day of order. The item is very well packed. Sound quality is good but there is a noticeable delay in sound. Will update after a week of useI won’t recommend this product. Connection problems everytime you have to forget and connect. Its better to go for other options
Airdopes seems to have a problem with connectivity issues. Although they connect very well when they do but during phone calls sometimes they disconnect without warning and although it shows connected in the phone but the sound comes from the phone speaker. That's not a good thing.
Sound quality is good and battery is good but when we are in call it will get disconnected automatically for every 3-4minutes and connect again.  Even in replaced product alsoUnable to pick whatsapp call.
Good sound with good bass.Easy connectivityGood battery back upNice design
But it has excellent sound quality and noise cancellationYou feel as if you are all together in different world
Hi I just wanted to know..as I have gone through the review before buying it .. that the better backup is good but in my case I don't think it's a good battery backup.plz suggest
"Not a very good product, sound quality and noise cancelation is very good but they are not comfortable, you can't wear them even for half an hour and mic quality is also very bad"
"After using this product for 1 week, I wanted to tell my experience, audio is good, bass is excellent, noise isolation for calls is ok, didn't except much isolation in this price category, overall it's a good product in this price range"
Left earpiece is not working despite charging it for  equal amount of time as the right earpiece. Defective product delivered but there was no issue with the packaging as it was sealed. It was unfortunate to receive a defective product.
I writing the review after usage of 2 hrs.Sound quality - 8/10Bass quality - 10/10Battery life - 10/10Built quality- 9/10For Calling - 7/10Value for money - 9/10Charging speed - 8.5/10
"Sound quality : the airdopes adopted a strange radio like sound after 5 days of use; disappointedThe charging case also showed signs of defect.Please note: that this item is not refundable, and if you ask for replacement, they will give you the same product, no freedom to choose another product"
The product is good as always. BoAt keeps its quality. But please guys don't go for offer products. These sellers are selling damaged products. I recently bought this product and it had some sound problem on its left bud. So I replaced it and again the replaced product's right bud had a very bad touch recognition. I called Amazon and they are not answering to my questions also properly.
Not being able to return this product. Received a defective one. Does not connect to the phone device amd one bud is not working. I tried everything it not working plus Amazon's customer service is worse. Not being able to get hold of any number.
"The bass is too high, relative to the other frequencies, to the point of major discomfort. You can't listen for long without reducing the volume which also reduces the remaining frequencies too low to enjoy well. Not for audiophile edm lovers. Disappointed."
It was great initially. But I after 10 days it is stop working. My 2k amount is full waste. Please don't buy this product; it is just hit or miss.
"It's very average product, compared to boat brand.But only if very cheap budget product is the purpose"
The airpods are really good if you are a all time party maniac. Bass quality really high and sum up sound is above average. I totally recommend this one or you can also go for oneplus earbuds z!!
It's technical descriptions are as good as given in manual..But ears start paining if you wear it for long time such as marathon running etc..
"I got it Airdopes today. I really enjoyed the sound quality , its fit nicely in ears..As suggested go thru manual & start using .."
"I didn't expect this much quality at this price, It's an amazing product with sound quality more on the bass side.Loved the product and also it's battery life."
"Excellent earphones at this price point 2k, quite perfect sound for the bass lovers with bass punch 👊. Overall performance is perfect. Good job boat team. Fruther keep it up...If anyone wants better than these then go to price range 4k and above..."
"Bought this product due to its battery backup. But it is all false. I have got a replacement of this product and even after that I found that I was getting less than w hours of backup. As per the box it informs of giving 5 hrs of playback, so disappointed."
"Worth every pennyThese earbuds are really amazing sound quality wise and even help with noise cancellation upto a certain limit.Fits perfectly in your ear, just the rubber wings start to cause pain if you are wearing these for too long maybe for more than 2 or 3 hours. They pair with your phone as soon as you open the case so thumbs up for that as well."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Better quality than other earphones of the same range…sound and product quality both are good and can also be used while calling. It doesn’t fall easily from the ears."
"not durable, with in 20day sound quality got down. Also there is problem with one ear bud. Had very bad experience with all the boat ear phones. Had raised the concern but don't know if they will replace with new or provide refurbished. Very disappointed don't buy."
Best earbuds for price..Good back up as mentioned.Charging case is awesome.Good fit in the ears.Not ergonamically designed to remove the buds from case..
"Ear buds are good but not fitting in ear, it can drop any where, so use it only indoor, not wear during adventure ride"
"For this price range, this product is okay. Not too great, not too bad.Its disconnects automatically and reconnects sometimes, while in use. Battery capacity is also not that great.Sound effects are good."
"I want return this item... Help, how I return"
"It's almost a month , I sent these airdopes for service as it was not working properly I have not received it back yet and I don't think I'll get it back worst service experience everNever go for boat products I have wasted my 2000 rs and it is a big dealPathetic pathetic pathetic"
"The product is really good. Quality of Sound and bass is fantastic. The fit is also quite good, it does not get lose even while running and playing. It does not have noise cancellation. Battery back up of both ear piece and the charging case is quite good. Capacitive touch is very responsive."
Positive points:-➡Sound quality- 5/5➡Bass quality- 4.2/5➡Design & Build- 4/5➡Comfort - 3/5➡Battery backup- 4.5/5➡Noise cancelation- 4.5/5Negative point:-➡You can't listen 1.5hrs or more because it will pain in your ears➡ Price for this product should be 1499/ but I have buyed it for 1999/ INR.
While running you feel like it will come.off and with a bit of sweat it's gone.On streets the sound quality is pathetic. With both earbuds yes it works well in a quiet room.But I will recommend not to go for this. Try to spend some 500-700 more and buy a good product.
"At the price range, this is the best product available in the market. The bass is better than most of the high priced competitors, though clarity is just about average. Minus one 🌟 because I received a used product with some amount of wax in one of the ear piece."
"Love the battery,bass,sound cancellation everything is perfect at it's price! Definitely recommend this for anyone thinking of buying this product! Got delivered 1 day before the delivery date! ^_^"
"Overall the quality is Good.Sound is good for the price, Nice water Resistance.The only issue i faced in my 8 months of semi Heavy usage is that the left ear bud discharges in about 30 mins of usage, wish it lasted for at least about a year. Warranty service is poor. No more Boat products for me now."
Love the look feel and comfort as also sound quality. Working well these many days since the purchase.
Superb product one should buy. It has been 1 month i am using.
Pros- Battery is good- Does not fall off easily from ears- Bass is okCons- Not suitable for gaming(pubg)- eartips are uncomfortable after 2 hrs of use
"Good product by boat I got it for 2000 it is good but I think price is higher but I would recommend, go for it although battery backup is not that good so you can try noise buds instead of this"
"Got it during the product launch, hardly used it 1-2 times a week.Completely stopped working within 6 months, the ear bud is also heating when used - Really scared to use it.Really bad product life!"
Excellent power horse with 2600 mAh battery...Good bass and charity...Much better range than other earbuds...capacitive controls make it still better..Hope this keeps me going for a year or two..
"A must have product what's good about this is sound quality and durability, use in any condition this will. Survive.. The only problem I faced is the on off button on with a single press also the buds gets off, other than this all I say buy this"
"when i received the item, the polythene bag was torn and the parts (charging cable, earbud ring) of the item were missing. the item was seemed used one. i am very much disappointed with item. i hope it wont happen again."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I ordered and paid for a new product but I have got a renewed product from Amazon. Product quantity is good but still I have paid for a new product then why should I accept a renewed product, right...So I hope I will get a resolution from you.Thank you so much."
Boat boat one of the best company for Earphones . This buds Is so good it’s crystal clear sound is awesome. Battery backup also good .
First of all the sound quality is good. But I would like to draw the attention on the ear buds I'm facing problems with ear buds they don't work simultaneously and this  irritates me. I wish could change the ear buds . Anything can be done in this matter it will be very helpful 🙂. Thank you
music quality is good but the mic is horrible and the worst quality if you want to listen ony music then you can go for it(but you have many good options for this in lower price)but if you want to make calls then please dont ever think it will provide you anything or even 1% of quality
I am using wired Sennheiser cx175s earphone sound quality and bass mid range not like that don't expert to much but value for money battery life is good sound quality is nice in power amp player app
"It's hurt ear if wear for more then 30 mts further sometime bluetooth connection also fail, and if u don't fix it properly it's fall down also hence u need to be careful overall battery life is good"
I love this product. It's sound quality is awesome. The fingerprint sensor works perfectly. I use it for classes for 2 hours a day and I need to charge the box only once in a week. It charges very fast and remains for a long time. Thank you Amazon🥰🥰🥰🥰
"The Device charges fast, fits in the ear . But the sound almost equal to Boat rockers. Not up to the mark of Sony.Its just value for money TWS."
After 3 months the right one got found to be not working even I have not used for more than 15 hours in 3 months.Don't buy this. Totally shot.WASTAGE of money.
I like the product a lot. Its performace is very good. Got a good battery backup once completely charged. Quality of sound as well bass is excellent. I really feel value for money after paying the amount.
Left earbud volume dropped within a month.Have tried factory resets multiple times.Raised complaint under warranty. Waiting on service.Will keep this review updated.
"Everything is ok the built  quality ,noise cancellation , charging backup but the main feature of boat which was lagging behind was it's bass was too low... As the trademark of boat was buss but you can't expect with this airpods"
Microphone quality is terrible. Virtually impossible to have a conversation on the calls as the sound is either muffled or echoes. Not useful as a handsfree set.
"Really impressed... good bass Just at the low volume its a bit too soft need the volume on 65 percent onwards to get a really good feel.really loved it.. sound.. calling... better noise cancellation.. good bass.. Bluetooth connection everything is great...quite lighter,fixes in the ear well"
"Using the product from.last 6 month. If buying the product for static use it,s fine within range. But if your purchasing it for jogging or for using while exercise it will disappoint you repeat Don't purchase it for running or exercise purpose."
"These air dopes are just so reliable. They have good bass not too much, not to little.Also the capacitive touch control is just so responsive. I love it when products have a good feature and they do it right. The battery capacity is phenomenal..."
Really a bad product! Sound clarity was not clear at all all the times! I was scruied up by my work clients that bad quality audio and some times it keeps on audio distortion at the receiver end.  I was able to hear the voice but audio at receiver end is really bad.
Really great & punchya bass quality. If you are a bass lover then just go fr this one. Overall build quality of earbuds is premium touch is very sensitive. Bt when calling you can hear background noise and have talk in normal to a lil bit louder fr next person to hear u clearly
After 3-4 months of usage its battery backup has become very less. Maximum 1 hour running on normal sound and also it's sound quality is not as expected.
The left ear bud just stopped working and not getting charged.Boat I didn't expect this from you guys....This would be my last product from Boat....No more Boat......
A continuous static noise in the left earbud. Nice build and sound quality. Super comfortable. My only issue is with the continuous static crackle in the left ear the moment you open chrome or YouTube. Too irritating to handle.Returning it.
It was nice but after 15 days now it got problem I can connect with my phone but the calls and sound system is not working... Really discounted help me and tell how can I exchange and where I don't have any BOAT store around our city...
"The sound quality is OK. I could say that about the design and the material too. However, the war phones are quite expensive at Rs.2500."
"Sound quality is good, great bass levels for a inear plugs at this price"
"-There is a light static sound heard when we put it on , it goes after 5 seconds.-Can hear distorted noise after 15 mins of usage."
I am unable to listen anything when my Airpods are connected on incoming and outgoing calls. Neither the other person on the line is able to hear. Was not expecting something like this from boat. Pathetic experience would not suggest anyone to take boat headphones.
"Very satisfied with the product! I personally like these better than my airpods 2. I use a 1+ 6t so it's very convenient as it uses Type-C cable.Excellent noise cancellation,great battery life and connects to my phone instantly.And the best part,it lights up when you touch it ! :p"
Blindly go for this product.Sound and bass quality is superb at this price point and also battery backup is good.Trust me guys this product meet expectations and it delivers pure audio and clean bass.I tried realme buds air 2 but it is waste of money.
Like the product but I can hear more noise when I was talking n I'm not able to hear a person voice clearly... That is the problem otherwise it's goodThank you
"I recently bought two pieces of this product. The product seems to be working fine but the flaw in this very product is that it during gaming the sound lag keeps going on. So if anybody wants suggestion about this very product, the product is awesome but for music listners or video etc. But for gamers i will not vouch for this very product..."
"Good for music listners at this price.A bit uncomfortable fins, needs a bit more blunt edges. (small ones are there & quite comfortable, but pained after 30 min due to its edges).Microphone isnt that good outdoors.Good treble, decent bass.Case lid feels quite cheap."
Im first ordered boult really disappointed and returned also after the arrival of boat to my home its master pieceBass4/5Noise cancellation4/5Only con i faced is very long hours of listening is not possible its uncomfortable at ears tanq.
The product may look fancy with nominal price. But it's not worth buying.No noise cancellation & it stops working almost after a year which makes you having no option to get the replacement.
Again and again the quality of the audio is very poor.  This item has no value for the money I bought and paid for 2400 rupees.  Refund my money to me.  I buy better stuff than this. Don't cheat the customer by doing fake glamorous advertising and ratings like this anymore.
Product is ok.. The batery life n fitting is good but no clearity at all .. The driver is very small(6mm). ... Cant get good bass or vocals... Dont buy
These are. Just okay for listening music it's not properly supporting for calls even though I have replaced it both are having same problem but the built quality is osm the only problem with these is these are not properly supporting calls ..!
"Nice product, sound quality is good, i bought it and than replace coz the sound was getting very low, but after replacing the product i felt that you can get more better option instead of boat 441 with low cost..for calling purpose its not good ... Bass quality is super good for music lover."
"Its not worth its gud to used in home , out side its background noice is too much ,  ear rubber little but pain caused , initially backup is gud aprox 4-5 hrs but now it’s decreasing last only 3 -3.5hrs ."
"Average product, there are a lot of connectivity issues. For the price it's a good product though."
Pathetic quality. Didn't work properly beyond the return window. Service centre too shockingly bad. Warranty claim methodology regressive and time consuming. The helpline is alsi useless and e mauls do jot yield any result. Buy Boat producte at your own risk
This is the worst wireless earphone. Its have a huge connectivity problems. Even after warenty servicing it does not work good. Sound quality and noise cancellation is good but the main issue would be the connectivity specially during a call.
1.No return policy in Amazon for this product beaware of it before you buy2.It's excellent with sound effects and bass effectMic is not good you need to speak louderPerson with small ear it won't fit goodOverall it's good to watch movies and play games not recommended for use with phone calls
"I am writing this review after using it for 3 month.Please don't buy this Airdopes if you are using it for watching only movie and series for longer period of time, if you use it for less period of time than it's ok, bcoz it gives backup of 3 - 3.5 hours which is less than the given hour."
"The sound quality, bass and battery life is amazing but the toch of both earpods stopped working within 2 months of use. I used all sound device from boat but this product is faulty and I'm cut off from Boat because of this. The product is faulty, very very disappointed by Boat this time."
"Pros:1. Sound quality is good but not awesome2. Range is okay, around 10 meters3. Connectivity is goodCons:1. If used to make call, other party observe lots of noise. Hence not good for making phone calls2. Charging lasts only for around 2.5 hours"
There is a huge delay in audio when I use this to connect calls and sometimes mic gets ON automatically.
"Cute looking. Perfect for girls. Excellent sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality during a phone call, listening to music or watching movie. Thank you. I wish someday will get the masaba collection at this price range."
Sound quality and battery life are at par with the expectations. A slight disappointment occurs when it comes to the Bluetooth connection. There are glitches while it connects automatically to the phone.
"Terrible product..stopped working in 2 months..stay away from this one and consider a better brand even if it's costing few hundred bucks more, it will be usable for longer duration and worth your money."
Not a worthy product as u cannot use for more than 15 minutes. Ears start paining with regular usage. Also mic has very poor noise cancelation.
"The title says it all, these are reliable and are a reasonably good pair of earphones. If you choose to buy them remember losing one of these is a bit too easy. ok product overall."
Good Quality and  base quality also fine and quick bluetooth connection nice look and long battery life.
Compact. Easy to use. Dock can be used to recharge mobile also in emergency. Easy to carry around.
"Right ear pieces volume started to drop slowly slowly and then has stopped working, it has good sound quality. But built quality is very cheap I have been facing the problem of gradual decrease involume from past 2 months and now the right ear piece is completely un-audible."
"Sound quality and design are awesome. The bass is so natural. Quality product in this price. But sometimes only one plays and other one stays off. As a result, i have to manually restart that airdope for proper stereo sound. I think its not a big issue."
The durability is very bad. Dropped it twice accidentally and the right one doesn't work in a normal position I have to tilt my head in a certain angle or else it wont work pretty disappointed.otherwise it is good. Just be careful not to drop it.
This is the worst product I have ever buy from Amazon. I will never recommend it to anyone. It just stopped working after few months.
Boat really nice productSeller is very good and fastMusic panch👌ColorBattery backup my god 150 hoursMusic quality 👌Thank you boat.seller.amezon
Great product. Value for money.Excellent quality and looks. Made in India.Very lite.
Meet my expectations my first choice is Sony and second choice is boat really I love it in this price
Ordered for my boss and is working awesome
It's a great product! Compact and small in size which makes it invisible in your ears.Also the Sound quality and Bass is much better as compared to other products in the market.Battery performance is Awesome as well! Happy with the product - a must buy!
"The left earbud makes a ""hisss"" sound which is called static noise which is noticable when volume is less than 50 -60%....and this issue is in the product itself ...every airdope has this issue which is very irritating when u attend calls bcoz as soon as the speaker stops speaking....the hisss sound begins to disturb you!"
"No noise cancelation. When one device is connected then lack of problems to connectivity, automatically device was connected and disconnected and several problems. And many problems when I was connected this device then over call,no one here me properly...please return my money plz ...."
Bass an sound quality is impressive u wil just fall in love wit this product
"When you get it, it feels amazing. The sound is good. Works well too. But then it stops working in 2 months. Only one of my earphones works now. Please don't buy this."
Always wanted ear pods but because of the cost was too high never purchased however this product is reasonable and worth the money! Best in price quality.. Happy with the product ☺️
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Product is very niceBut built quality is slightly badBut bass, pairing, material anything is good I'm buy red colour ❤️ is awesome feel like sporty 😎Compare to JBL c100tws vs boat 441??according to me is boat airdopes 441 is better than JBL c100tws 👍So, I'm giving 9 out of 10 (9/10)Thanks Amazon and boat"
There is some problem with Boat airdopes as the right side airdope has battery issues and goes off very fast compare to left side. I have even received replacement but still the same issue persist after repeated charging. Iam totally unsatisfied with the product and would urge all the peoppe to refrain from this product
"After talking on this for 15-20 minutes, left side is getting disconnected and other person is unable to listen my voice"
Facing issues but no help customer care provide contact which never works and the the address shared is not available. If you want to waste money go for it
Dear boat you are very smart so pls make youre products also smart ..I order this 4-5day ago and now one or airdopes is not working what the hell is that are you selling fake product are u trying to make pol fool pls keep some respect .Sound is good but one of aur doors is not working why ???And have scratches on pack.
Till now I was using one plus wireless 2 but after boAt Airdopes 441 pro arrived I have stop using one plus and using boAt coz it's quite comfortable than one plus and easy to operate totally satisfied and happy.
This is a Chinese item. Cleverly written a made in PRC (PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA). THE WEBSITE MENTIONS IT NOWHERE IN ITS PRODUCT DETAIL. IT CAN ONLY BE SEEN IN THE FAQs.
1 star only for receiving Made in China product. I went for Indian brand but it turned out as china product. Rest of the quality and specification all are Good at this price range.
Product works only for two weeks after that it is not working and when trying to claim through warrenty there is no proper response from Boat support team for more than a month.
"The earbuds are okay, but the boosted bass it provides  will make your ear paining. Good for normal music and calls"
It’s a horrible product for someone who wants clear sound and I don’t mean demanding for crisp and quality sound. This is a cheap headset but at least the sound during a call could be decent. I am finding it hard to express my disappointment with this crappy product.
It is better than other products in this range. Bought this on discount and loved the sound quality. Apt bass sound for the ears. Get rightly adjusted to your ears. Special thanks to Amazon for delivering the product well on time.
Quality is good. Been using boat earphones for about a 2 years. I would say the sound quality is better in wired boat earphones of rs 300 rather than the boat airdopes 441 which costs more than rs. 1700. These are for the people looking only for a good bass and not crystal clear sound.
Sound quality is awesome with full outside noise cancellation.Bass is pretty good. Overall value for money product.Got it at a good discount. Only extra ear plugs are written at the package but no earplugs inside the brand package.
Seller gave me defective product after 7 days complete.Airdrop right mic is not working.I purchase product on 17aug .Not one month also completeOn 13 sep  I gave my product to boat service center to replace it .And today is 25sep no improvement.Don't buy from this sellers.
"Not a good fit on ear. You can't exercise with these on, without then falling off at least 4 times.Plus the sound is very low volume. Often times one of the eardopes, just goes mute"
Well.. If you are wants to buy it only for music then these are super best.. But if you are looking for calling and gaming also with music then these my not be suitable.. No background noise cancellation also audio lag is there if you are playing a game. But again they are best for music fans out there.. So chose it wisely.
The airdopes are nice in comfort and in build quality also but I feel the case is not that strong in quality after all the products is nice but if you thinking to take then wait for sales you will see the nice price drop on this product so it will value for money that time
Earbuds is good in sound quality when it comes to music.When it comes to call quality its poor by far. I have replaced twice but issue remains same.Every 5-7 mins noise will be distorted and have to reconnect after 5- 7 minsThis is so much annoying.
Very good product....sound quality is good and the bass is nice.... the fit is good and u won't know that u r wearing them after a while...they r very light weight and the packaging quality was nice....the product was very well packed...over all good experience
For music it's perfect but if you want to talk It's not the best. the person on the other side complaints about the Background noise too much when you're outside. Otherwise even sound on call is great.
"One of the speakers is dead after a year, otherwise awesome sound quality, and noise cancelation. Far better than skull candy, JBL, and similar brands.Worth price."
I used noise x5 pro before this. Compared to that this one has little less volume as driver size is small. Bas quality is not upto the mark. This is a ok ok product.
"This airdopes is very nice and better.but this noise clearence is very bad,this is use to room and office working is good. but traveling time this airdopes is working bad.but this feature is very good."
"A very convenient, classy and a budget purchase. Perfect delivery, perfect packing. Very easy to use and great sound quality with all mentioned qualities. Do not think much before purchasing this product. It is an absolute perfect EarPods one would require. Not to forget, it comes in a beautiful Masaba edition colour box. Loving it."
Sound quality is goodProduct quality is bestGaming experience is at low latancyNo volume control from ear budsEverything is awesomeThe only bad experience was with calling no noise cancelation ( you need to be at quit place for talking)Other person can hear clear voice of surrounding that's the bad thing about ear budsOver all its awesome and worth of money
It had been 3months since i bought this product.In the first two months it was working in agwu good way but after that disturbances were started now the disturbances have became more noisy that it is hard to listen to the audio playing in it. It is totally irritating me now.
In Amazon website battery 30hrs  but here it's 35 hrs on box and it has only 2 dot charging on earpods wer it should have 3 dot and not happy with product showing on website smthing delivery smthing else not expected this from Amazon for the 1st time such bad experience from Amazon...
"Not good product.. easy to use. Good sound ,, but the problem is battery back up. The right bud discharges quicker than the left one. And the problem occurs since the beginning.. I've been with this for last 5 months."
"Not good as expected.  Already the right airpode voice is not clear, it seems to be damaged. Left one is ok. Sound quality is bad. There is a gap in voice transmission from phone to airpode. It looks beautiful but it has a tendency to fall from ear. So overall not good for use while travelling, can use only when you are at not moving."
"Probably one of the best sounding earbuds I've used. Very comfortable as well, and I also love the fact that they provide extra earbud tips of different sizes. Bass quality is better than most bluetooth speakers available in the market. Very satisfied."
"Truly wireless design with bluetooth wireless technologyLong battery enough 500 mah with charging case, with around 18 hrs backup (box included)Easy wearable, waterproofhands free calling, google Voice assistantEasily and fast wake and pair"
it looks cool and its connectivity is v.good..sound quality is good but not best.. bass quality is high for ppl loving high bass.. in and all i wud give 4 out of 5..
"No sound cancelation in the earphones. The other side person can hear background sound more than the your voice. Also, the touch pad of left side earphone was not working.The sound quality is good when you listen to music."
Stopped working after a normal usuage of 1month .volume is very low in both the earbuds.Microphone reception was very flawed from the beginning.Nearby noises will be heard louder then your own voice by the microphone
A good product. I have been using it since 1 week. The bass is good.Don't go for the Negative Comments I have researched every earbuds available at this price so you can go for it. Latency is also Low!
After 1 month use.Noise cancellation doesn't work. I give a big ZERO 0/100.Sound quality is balanced its ok but not like a true wireless.Battery lasting atleast 2 h 30m.
"Everything is good except main thing music sound.If you want to use this airdopes for call,go for it ...For music its worst ..all you hear is noice. Boat with wired earphones works much better than this."
Got 'em during primeday sale for 1800 buks. Great wireless heads for the price. Have changed nearly 6 TWS before took a decision to keep these.
No doubt about the sound quality. Terrific noise cancellation. But it doesn't shows hopw much battery is left in the case and the ear phones hence cannot rely on it. Missing of battery indicator is the only cons I found in this ear phone.
Everything is nice the bass is nice battery quality is nice  mic also works pretty wellBut I don't understand what should I listen to ? The music that I want to or the irritating and annoying static noise in the left ear buds ? And there's no way to fix it ! Drained the battery to zero . Did factory reset it still persists !
100% satisfactory product.Better than aspects.
-The product is non-returnable that is once you purchase the item you can't return after u feel it is over rated or useless- we have to shout while on call for our voice to reach the other end so bad for calling comparatively-so think twice before you purchase
"The microphone is giving very low output, so ther other parties are hard hearing me. I am not happy with this.At times, the volume of the speakers are changing causing some background noise.As a whole, I don't recommend buying this product"
"Good build quality, but not comfortable to wear. It often disconnect while video calling."
This product is frequently got repaired.when I first time call to service centre they come and pick up product but takes 10 to 15 days time.later second time the product also repaired no one is caring and say go to service centre and repair it.the service centre is 24kilometera from my place.
Airdopes pro stands to the claim that the company make. The charging case with ~150hrs backup is commendable. You don’t need to plug the case to a socket every now and then. Sound quality is good. Haven’t heard complaints on noise over a call either.
I like the touch sensitivity of the earbuds.It eases the extra work .The earbuds are soft and comfortable to ears.
Sound quality is excellent 👍Bass also too good 😊But price too muuchconnectivity is very fast😘Bad things is cal or market and rush area's not good micro phone catch wide range of voice 😏
If u want a budget tws this is the best option.....noise cancellation is ok.not great but the bass is finominal......a must buy product
"If you want to size up your ear canal and further trouble your ears, go for it. The product is disappointing one to those who prefer health over technological ease."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 When it arrives I saw there was no seal on the product , product was open,also there is no charging cable inside the box,also there is scratch on the product also on one earbud,I didn't expect this I am very Dissatisfied."
"Using it from last few days, I have seen no issues. Audio is awsm. And call quality is like normal earphones no complaint at all."
"Made in china , no comments, came to know only after purchase . Amazon must display the product orgin country to help decide the purchase.Jaihind."
"Please dont buy BOAT product, noise cancellation not working, mic not working properly, right side airdops stopped workong after service of 1 month now left side airdop is not working dont waste the money for this cheap product"
If I wanna say in a straightforward way...so it's just bass.. nothing else ..the bass is too High that you cannot hear the vocals properly.... every line of song has excess bass....while buying this I was too excited but it broke my heart!! ....so not recommended to buy.
Had earlier gone to ptron and other bakwas earbuds but BOAT is exceptional it's all mode of operation is very good the clarity of calls and music is excellent
"Yes , it is great product and 2600mah battery , her sound quality is good , there vocals and trebels are clear .. their bass is fanatic and performance is great... and call quality is fabulous ... if it is available for 2499rs plz plz go for it and 3500rs i dont recommend you... thank you"
Considering the price it has nobdown side .If this is your budget you have the best buy.
"I use it 15-16 hours everydayIt is phenomenal in sound quality & battery life.....Main thing is it doesn't hurt ears for long times , it's my 1st tws & the best in segment 🔥🔥🔥"
Sound :Music quality and bass far batter then oppo w31 and realmi buds air.Call :Listening is goodAnd if you use only one buds the call quality at the recipient end will be good enough.
"It came In a well packed condition, groovy colour and azong sound quality, definitely worth the money spent. Fits well, easy to pair with devices and works like magic. Great job team Boat 👌"
The delivery of Amazon was awesome as usual. Got this product with a day.Coming to this product. The audio quality is decent with stable bass. Battery lasts for around 3+ hours in a single charge.Although I have used Noise TWS. but this one looks cool. Go for it if you have a budgyof around 2k to 2.5k
"You are wasting customer's time by selling this product. Your service has started to falter because of this. It is time for me to return this product for the second time. It's time to return this product. So far no one was able to send in the perfect solution, which is not strange."
I am writing this review after 5days use .. BoAt airdopes best in look and sound ..I got this at 1999rs as great indian sale in Amazon .. sound quality is very good ..look is top class ... Bass should have be better .. overall the good product ..go for it .
"Good bass and good sound quality.The charging case feels so light and small in hand fits in pocket easy. The packaging was not good, other than that good product by Boat"
"This company doesn't deserve a rating. This is the worst company for earphones in India. Replaced my product for 2 times. Now again I've raised a complaint as one side is not working. The worst of all, better purchase any other brand. I've wasted ₹2,499 on this. Please do not waste your money."
"Super awesome ear dopes. I purchased it on 10oct and charged its battery to 100%. Today is 19nov, I have not charged them, and it still has 50% battery. These ear-dopes are too good. I bought them on my friend's recommendation and I also recommend it to my other friends."
Extremely bad mic.. the person on the other end can't hear me at all.! The voice is too feble to be heard by the person on the other end.! Not sure how this product has soo many good reviews.
My niece just loved it. Good sound quality and the the product built is good. Looks damn cool.
"Hi, my name is anjenuyulu I order this Bluetooth at 15may and I got this order at 22nd may but on that day I noticed some charging problem of Bluetooth and sound also so low that’s why I requested to return this order on 23nd may but I requested before one week but no one pickup this item,kindly please pickup this order,Thank you."
"Best at this price! I bought these back in June 2020 and, Trust me, you'll never get such amazing quality truly wireless earbuds at this price. Way better than realme buds air, ptron, all those other brands. Simply go for this one! Boat products offer great quality and experience"
i have used this product up to 3 months its performance is good but after 3 months whenever i am on call it is connected and disconnected automatically on call but when i am using for video listening music then its performance is working properly.
Do not buy. Its cheap chinese product...bluetooth connectivity problem.. Left earbud is having some manufacturing defect. I replaced and found same problem with left earbud.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 A quality product for such a decent price. I got it when the lightening deal was on... You will never regret it. Sound and bass are just awesome. Will soon update about the battery back up..."
Good product by Boat. Sound quality is balanced. Bass is not too much high but its good in this price range. Noise cancellation is good. So if you are thinking to buy this product then you must go for it.
Right ear machine has very low sound. Tried to resolve the same through reset but it didnt happen. Can someone suggest ways to address the same
"Products had a problem from the very first day. Left the left earbud started giving trouble. The left sometimes work sometimes doesn’t. Also, the back was not up to the mark. It’s supposed to give me a back up of 5hrs but it lasted for only lest than 2 hours. Hence, had to return it and ask for a replacement."
I found very disturbance on call. According to price not up to the mark. I thought the boat has a good product and a genuine product but seriously poor performance while someone talking to you on call. I used this from 1 month and now i am writing this review..Not recommend to anyone.
"Sound Quality is goodThere is no noise cancellation, cannot use for callingMy right side earpiece got battery issue after 7 months.They replaced under warranty but the product recieved in warranty is of low cheap quality and appears like a copy of original purposely made for warranty replacement."
"On calls people complained that my voice would always be faint with this device.I returned it, as one of the main reasons for purchase was making calls.With music the quality was good."
Good products. This is not support voice call even i replace item. Every 1minute disconnected and connect after 20 second
However it make your ear sound proof which sometimes irritates you and can not plug it in your ear for long duration like more than one hour.
"Within 2 and half monthd one of the earbuds stop functioning suddenly. This is not at all feasible. Whenever u run with this one, u'd be scared of dropping down from the ear. Worst.. As expected. Made in China product."
I got it replaced about 3 times before warranty period was over since it had some issues after 3months of purchase only but the service was quick every time. Now it's working fine.Beside that : Battery back : as prescribedSound quality : not as good as JBL but fine
"Very bad product.The product get obsolete in the first few weeks of usage.1: Imbalanced sound in both earbuds2: charging issues3: low sound quality4: touch delay5: low bluetooth signal capacity.Should have gone with Noise, or some alternatives."
I really like this product .... I am using it from last 8 month ...  And it's performance is as good as  when I buy it ....  No any issue.. . Only 2 time I reset it cause of  connectivity problem ... And I think it's not a big issue..It's common
"Bilkul faltu Airdope hein.Bas naam ne he kha liya hein Boat ko bt. koi kam ka nhi or sound quality ekdm faltu. Touch control bhi bekar hein.i prefer #OPPO Enco buds bcoz its provide Touch volume control,sound quality & voice Quality is Best in this segment."
Too much Ear Pain.. Cannot bare the pain.. Hurts severely..
I used to get headache if I use it more than 3-4 hrs. on a daily basis so stopped using it now bought in September 2020 and used only for 2 months now it is like waste.Wired ear phones are always better than these Bluetooth earphones.sound quality good in this price range mike captures the voice little late.
"On high volume, Right side ear piece sound cracks.. May be I have received a defective product... Till the time I have noticed, return policy expires...Bass is not very good..."
What a waste of money I purchased it for workout and making calls but although putting earbuds on case for all the time still battery low and when you are making calls the other person is not getting your voice properly they are listening outside noise rather than your actual voice
Don't buy boat they are cheating with you after a 20 days the airdopes stops working and you can't make a replacement worst  experienceThe customer care is just fake they don't receive your calls and even on website you cannot raise a complain
It has charing issue the first day its a loss buying this product connectivity issue with ios device realy that to late delivery and we receive this  kindly check the product once you buy after putting money we received this kidly be alert with such product
🥳Price is reasonable but still it doesn't have nosie cancellation . Except nosie cancellation everything is fine i am satisfied with this product ☺️. Has a very good connectivity i.e it has good range and fast pairing
"connectivity is gr8 ... sound quality is gr8 ... simply go for it ... i bought another set of same eardopes ., from the store as i wanted red colour .., go for it"
The product i recieved is very good in term of sound battery backup everything is ok the case charge the pods 5 times properly but the only thing is that the battery backup of podes is little less as they only work for 3-4 hours for me but overall i am happy with product
"Latency is a problem when coming to gaming and all.. the sound lags behind games, but it is not happening while watching videos.Apart from that the product is superb and the quality is worth mentioning."
I am reviewing this product after one month use . In this price segment this is really impressive . Sound quality is good at 80% volume.  Trust me or not this is much appreciable than I expected. The case will last upto one week for normal use after one charge . Overall good product.
Left airdope is good.. and can able to connect from distances.. while the right one is not equally doing it. Am I the only one facing this issue?
One bud disconnects unnecessary not connecting properly to bluetooth.Also some time both bids coneects with mobile but sound not able to hear.Noise cancellation not working.Bass ok
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The sound quality is best and I like it. And the Bass is very boosted and excellent and in outdoor calling is not so much good but good and indoor calling is very good if you are a bass lover go for it. Overall the airdopes are very good it is value for money."
"Sound quality is good fitting in ear is also good, everything is going fine and 4th day i lost my headphones filled with pain i am writing this review so please take care of your headphones"

 Boat Airdopes 441 this product is very bad quality 18 15 days afternoon at work left side is connectivity for money waste shopping this product and 40% Amazon selling is duplicate"
This one is average product as the capacitive touch is so lazy it works when it feels to work. There is no noise cancellation and sound is good but not that good. It would be better to purchase neck band earphones rather than TWS of lower range.
"The worst quality ever. I purchased it but it's voice transmission was not good therefore I replaced it but again the same defect was found. It's sound quality, noise cancellation & bass quality everything is poor. Please do not buy this product"
Bass is awesome. I don't know why some people are not happy with the bass in the reviews. Instrumentals and vocals are decent justifying the price range. Bass lovers will like these earbuds very much. Fitting is good but may hurt some ear types.
The sound quality is a little low on bass. But offers an overall balanced output. it's type-c and the battery backup is awesome. Also comes with fast charging. The best of the lot at this price.
Sound quality is ok but During call these bluetooth gets disconnected sometimes and other times both doesn't gets paired between each other. Worst experience..and you can't even return them..only option you get is replacement.
"Despite charging the earbuds for hours on end, the left earbud always discharges within 5 minutes of connecting, and more often than not, doesn't connect in the first place. Terrible"
"Sound quality is good.Easy to use.But during voice calls, there is No Voice Filtering.The other person hears all the added sounds around us in high pitch and ate not able to follow my words."
This is the best earphones in this proce range. The quality of sound is very good. The bass is very immersive
"Static in left earbud, many others have reported the same issue. Annoying while listening to songs at low volume. Boat customer care number never works. Their email is unresponsive. I already wrote a review but it got deleted. Many others are saying their reviews got deleted too. Never buying boat again..."
"Uncomfortable, they are heavy in ear. sometimes you accidently touch them and song changes.have to reset again and again if one side stops working"
"Sound Quality is good & Battery Backup is Plus,Noise cancellation is Bad,I purchased it for Rs.2,499 during sale in Nov,2020Go for it if your budget around or below Rs.2500.. and always check for newer version before purchase :)Thanks :)"
Overall the product is excellent but while charging you can simply put airdopes back in case but while charging the both lights of airdopes should popup otherwise one of them will charge full but the other won't this is major issue in boat for every wireless earphone
"I am a regular client of Amazon. This is something I am unable to accept. The bluetooth devise is not.working properly. It is very bad to witness, it doesn't work properly, also big brand is selling.the battery drained product. Not acceptable. I need money or replacement."
"AwesomeGood bass , low latency , played pubg no lagpremium case and buds , good battery backupBoAt is an Indian company but the product is manufactured in china"
"Mic doesn't work properly on either Airdopes. Also does not connect automatically after turning Bluetooth of device. I have several other products of boats speakers but here i am disappointed with product. No comfort using it as creates ear pain, No battery as promised for 5 hours, it does not even last for 4 hours.Worst product for its price."
it's an awesome earphone but during call you literally need to shout for the other person to hear.so not a product for callingits good for listening music and it has a good battery backup.
"Cheap connectivity, ear buds lagging many times when we hearing music or anything, ear buds are not working many times then you have to reset factory settings, also the bluetooth range of this product is not that good, One good thing about these product is the touch controls of the earbud, touch controls are too good."
I am using it last one week.  The connectivity to phone over Bluetooth is very rapid as it connects automatically after opening. The battery backup is too good and you can use the individual one also.
Believe me guys those who wants to move from wired earphones to wireless this is the one you should buy.Man! What a bass ans punch its like you are in movie theatre alone.I will make detailed review after few days.Also thanks for the fast delivery (less than 2 days).
Excellent earned.But for reply a call you have to sout. That microphone is not that strong.
Airpods are not working only used 5 months want my money back or new product as it has 1 year warranty
"Boat replacement service is through Blue dart and they cancel the pickup again and again without calling and when finally they picked up the product, boat sent the faulty earpiece again in replacement. Worst customer service by Boat."
"Left ear piece microphone is not working as expected, test it before in the return window and get it replaced if you find issues"
"Looks good, perfect sound quality, but not good in noise cancellation, provide good battery life, Price is reasonable according to product quality, touch assistance is little bit messy to understand but overall a good product.Big thumbs up for delivery speed (delivered in 36hrs) , perfect packaging, no defect in product 👍"
Must huy product but there is one issueThe hizz sound(buzz) which sound sometime just as unpleasant as compeling me to throw this every other thing is very good the noise cancellateion is for sure better than airpods pro if this fits you wellI can tell this as I have conpared both
"The bluetooth connectivity cuts off quiet often,else its comfy in ears.Ordered for replacement"
"Very handy, good sound quality with Bass.. Easy to operate.."
"I got a defected item, so I went for claiming waranty but in checking it they gave me the old one and even that is defective, don't go it, it's really a very bad product with very bad services. Even they don't have working customer care number, and also they don't respond to the mail's, they are dealing with very casualy."

 Purchase on April 14, 2021, As if now I don't have any issues. It is working good. All the features are working fine. Good to go to purchase it."
I am not satisfied bcos...1. Not comfortable with ears.2 It is Not easy to put in your ears.3. Quality not good.4 Too much price as compare its performance.5 Not easy to use.
It’s waste of my money only one earbud works left side is dead and I took it to canada for my son he just checked it today 25/10/2020 and the return window is closed thought this is a good company never checked in india now I am stuck with this crap 😣
Overall product is nice but I want to mention one issue with this podIn winter season if you wear cap above the pod and move your head or ear muscles than found problem like pause distortion in sound. it is making bad experience. pod should differentiate in human touch and cloth touch.
The only disappointment i have is that volume of earbuds cannot be controlled via the same. Rest it's a 4star
Sound quality is quite good but the there is a problem in charging them. The c-type cable which comes with the box is not able to charge the case and earbuds.
I have been using  Skullcandy smoking buds headphone and mi sports bluetooth headphone. For boat eardops 1. My ear hurts physically2. My ear hurts aftet listening to music. 3. Not at all clear sound. 4. Unnecessary bass.
"Really good for the price 2.5k ,bout on June 2020, asap when it launched , touch controls and small body these all are good ,I think it's best under 4k"
Simply magnificent. Once again Boat proved they are amoung the best
Frequent call disconnection... Worst experience... Do not buy this useless product... Writting this review after using product for 10 days....
"Good for music purpose only, not up to mark on calling n all.Also, lake of sound if connedted with laptop."
"The sound is quite rich and clear, but definitely not the clearest possible. The bass is decent, the battery life is great. Leave it to charge while you're going to freshen up (or overnight) and it lasts almost a ful day with regular use. The charging box can last for 2 weeks."
Its very Disgusting that these earphones got vandalize exactly after a year. Which was really not expected for the Company Brand like BOAT. Now i can't even go for a warranty as it has passed its warranty period. DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT 😑
Sound feels a bit distant at times while calling ... Otherwise a fantastic product at this pricepoint
"Total wastage of money. Since day 1,it keeps on getting disconnected as if I have been handled a fake Boat. Didn't expect such a failure product from such an esteemed brand and can't imagine how this product passed quality test(if there is such a thing)"
I have use this buds in crowd area face a problem to not out going my voice. Properly my voice is disturbed to receiver.plz make sure to this issue and fix it for next product.otherwise sound is good and base is balance. Product all over 4 star rating
Voice quality -amazingNoise cancellation -poorBase-goodBattery life -beyond expectationsFit inside the ear-very poorMinor problems of connection getting interrupted few times while on call !!
"Avoid buying this product. I have used this for a couple of months and now it doesn't work. It states that the same can be charged for 1.5 hours and will have a back up of 70 hours.. Even after charging this for a longer period of time, this doesn't work for more than 1 hour.."
Pros:Build qualityBattery backupReasonable pricePortability.Cons:Mids compromised at high volume.Bass over boostedCase cannot be opened with single hand.All above mentioned are based on my personal tastes and preferences. Product is being delivered within the specified time.  Thank you.
"Got these for my husband, he's loving them"
Good for audio and video but sometimes one bud stops working and on adjusting it connects again.Battery backup is poor since it can work only for 3-4 hrs then you need to charge it again.Not good for voice calls.Spend little more and buy a good pair of buds if you want it for seamless voice calls.
Product is good but whn u walk with the earphones on.. There is some sort of noise coming from inside the earphone.. May be.. Its npt tightly packed from inside... And the connectivity is a bit iffy... At times.. Still at ₹2000 its a steal... And the case build quality is okay.. Not the kind u expect but decent
Not as par with the kind of rating you see on Amazon. Sub par earbuds with no control on volume. Too loud with no good sound quality.
"Really disappointed with the product and guess what, Amazon does not have a return policy for electronic items. Even if they don't perform as advertised. You get to replace the lemon you got with a new lemon that a just as bad."
"echo sound issue, very low volume to others, would return but no option for returning pretty basic I don't know why they are charging 3k for this may be for power bankanyway not going to buy anything from boat"
Superb Sound. Gives tough competiton to Bose and apple airpods.However mic is a huge let down. The otherside almost never gets my voice clearly. The voice fluctuates for about a minute before stablizing. Mic volume is also low.
"Product is worth to buy as the quality and connectivity is awesome. The feel in air is secure and not loosen even in work-out. Sound quality is premium , good bass and vocals are noted.Overall good product"
The f.. The battery started lasting less and less. And now left earbud after full charging only lasts 40 min. Right one is okay. There are problems with connectivity. It all started after 2 months. Do not buy this sh.. I feel like hitting them with rock. Total waste of money.
Not happy with the product  sound in the left peace goes off erratically. Sometimes it works for 5 to 10 minutes. And sometimes not then goes off wants to replace it as the product is in warranty period
"I am very much satisfied about sound quality but noise cancellation is not so good. Battery life is awesome, but the indication of purple or red light is not blinking when the battery capacity is less than 75% as said in the user manual."
Somehow I lost my earbuds within a month but I liked the overall quality.Good sound quality in this budgetBuild quality and material was also goodBattery backup is decent (Usualy 1 and half day after complete charging
"It's just only for listening to music. Not supportive for taking calls it attending meetings. Even though it is fully charged and near to the system , voice is scrubling and breaking. Not a good choice if you want it to use for multi purpose"
The Earbuds are very good except the left earbud makes the buzzing sound continuosly and it wont stop at all... very iritating at low volume to hear the buzzing sound... good bass and battery back up....
"I have ordered boat 441 pro airdopes from Amazon which i have received on 13th August but its a defective product when i make calls, listen to music or start any video there starts some disturbing irritating noice continuously fom my left earbud and that noice stops once it is not in use."
It's a good product but my only problem with Boat is and this is the second time I am facing this problem is that one side generally stops working or has some issues. And this time it's not even been a month since I bought it and my left earpod has completely stopped working.
1. Package is good.2. Product is good.3. Sound quality is lesser4.Bass sound is goodFinally product looks pretty i got a product with 90% charging in sealed box..
"Touch controls wasn't working, ordered a replacement but retailer was delaying the replacement with zero response. Had to return the product."
These buds are good for one things and that is listening to music. They have a lot of connectivity issues and pairing issues. The mic sucks but time and having these many limitations makes it useless for even this price range.It’s better to go for something better than these. Not recommended at all.
"Bought these under sale for 2k. Sound quality is decent. Build quality is plastic and ordinary. Doubt how long would these last. Connectivity was easy. For the budget felt these were okay.  While we have other better options, gor for these if you are on a tight budget."
What a fast delivery by amazonIts a very good earbuds under this price range i recommend this to every oneVery good sound quality specially the bass( what a sound i must say)If u need to buy earbuds then pls go for its
I was looking forward to a budget-friendly one with touch controls and type C port. It works in a good range and we can use it more often. Even if we are going outdoor we can use it continuously for up to 20hrs. That's all about review hope ut was helpful. Thank You 😊
Best product under 2000. Please buy this product when it is on sale.I got this product of  Rs/-1800 best in segment.
Left side earpod stops working on its own and starts working after multiple reconnect and disconnect attempts.
I would say in this price no other tws can't offer this much great quality. Design is so cool plus bass is up to mark. The best thing about it is it's connectivity which is totally seamless.
The right ear bud is not holding charge even for 15 minutes. Because of that I am not able to use it as I desired to listen music. It is that my set may please be changed.
The product is not great in terms of noise cancellation/sound/bass quality.  I wouldn't recommend this for those who want to buy this for music.  There are better products which are way cheaper than this which gives a good output.
First it was working good.. but after few hours right side stopped working and m hearing distracted sound from left side...and now left side stopped working ...and its been only 6 hours I received it....and its used product ..I can see scratches on box...very disappointed by Amazon and trustable brand Boat
Product replaced twice with Amazon both time one air brd doesn’t work and now raised complaint with boat and will have to wait for 15-20 days to get it Servic.. very bad experience with product
If you are buying this item specially pubg so plz don't because sound may came after 2-3 dealy so don't buy for pubg!And also a good airdobs sound bass but Price is too high I think prize range 999-1499 !!
"Does not fit into ears. Though light wait and easy to use, no issues faced yet with battery backup as well. But fitting is no comfortable and hence lying useless at home."
I really like this product but  sometimes the  earbuds aren't working properly.  If i put both earbuds on  my ear then  the one eardbud (left/right)both . Will stop working  . But actually its amazing.. coming on to the noice cancellation its good and on sound quality its amazing ..... about bass  quality is awesome.❤
"Not satisfied with less charging capacity,sound and noise issue.When we talk over the phone we can hear lot of noise.It was so disgusting.Not at all worth.Finally we can't return this item.We can only replace with the same item.If we have chance to return we can pick other item but we don't have a chance."
"Sound quality is Good, Noise cancellation is also good, but the bass quality is not up to the mark as claimed by the company. Overall product is satisfactory, can go for it. Touch is not that sensitive."
Connectivity gets issued at times. Not very stable on ears. But a good one apart from these in this budget🤩
Protect your ears don't buy itProduct looks good but if you are looking for comfort than don't buy it. Your ears will start hurting after listening for half hour as it is not right fit for ears. You will start feeling uneasy and for sometime experience kind of deafness once you have turned off listening.
"In this price range, Maybe you won't get a product like this. But considering quality it's a too bad quality product.After using 15min my ears are paining. Call quality is horrible outdoor."
Just received the product. The left buds are not working fine. Sometimes they play and sometimes don't. I tried factory reset many times. Charged the case to full if there's any charging issue. Still not working. Music plays via right buds only. I have requested for replacement.Build quality is nice . Base is awesome. Quality of sound not on par with big brands.
Review after 3 mothn use...Best in segmentBest Sound quiltyBest Battery LifeEasy To carryBig Battery Case even You charge your mobile with this Box
Everything else is absolutely ok with these earbuds BUT for the battery lasting time. Its HORRIBLE  !! They won't  ever last beyond 40mins even when fully charged.Have to charge them again and again. The actual purpose of cordless ear buds is not served. Disappointed.
The overall product is good but if you are a music lover then please avoid it as the sound quality is not good but noise cancellation is good and we can speak or hear clearly when we are on phone . connectivity is good as it connects in seconds.
"Overall the earbuds are decent at this price range. The connectivity is good and fast.Sound quality is average ,bass is not good.during calls the earbuds do not connects with the mobile and is not able to recieve audio."
The quality is not at all good as most of the time only one ear connection works. By the time realised the return window got over :(
Best earbuds in this range with type c charger.  The sound and bass quality is mind blowing.If you are looking for wireless earbuds under ₹3000 then you have clicked on the best option boAt airdopes 441.Just go for it🙂👌✌🤟🤙👍💯😀
Has been using it since a week. It's nice and gives a classy look . The black colour is just stunning. It also comes with 1 year warranty card. You can use the airdopes constantly for 5 hrs . Overall a nice product.
"has got good bass, not too good in sound quality and clarity, did exchange it 2 times, 1st time there was a humming noise in one of the eardopes, and the second time the eardope battery drained very fast. good in portability sense, however not best overall."
Its too early to give feedback but I Just received and connected to my laptop and used for a zoom call but other person could hardly hear my voice. I think it's microphone isn't that good.
"When listening to music, one of the sides breaks.  After some time, another side breaks.Using this for 3 days.This is happening very frequently.This needs to be taken care of. Because, the flow of music is much important.Other than this, The sound quality,buttons are working fine."
Sound quality is ok but in just 1.5 months it got faulty now I can listen to the media through them but cannot answer a call as I don't get voice from them over the call. I had turned then off and then switched them on several times but problem still persists.
Purchased this product on 1 week ago. What I feel after 1 week usage of this product is that battery backup only last for 2hrs. Sound quality is not that good as I expected. Base level is very moderate. Noice cancellation works in reverse order. Not a good at this price point. Price should be 1000 rs only for this product.
Great product at the given price. Comfortable to wear. Strong bass. good for taking calls. Also both buds can be used for calling individually. Thus you never run out of power. Nice product.
Cheap quality product.Not working.And i want to replace the product and i have raise the issue regarding to it but amazon in not doing anything.Before return date expire i have raise the issue n ask for replacement but till today no reply.Very very bad service.
"Don't buy this product. There are unnecessary noises in left side airdopes. Sometimes it's also not connect with phone. Range is very less. Also you will become irritate after keeping it for 1-2 hours in your ears. Please go with other product, don't purchase this."
guys good product go for it.....if u dont hear any sound in your eardopes after connecting also then plz dont b scared just restart ur mobile n it will work.
"Sound Quality is good but ear grip is not that great, we need to be careful while it is in the ear. Expected better grip from boat."
They worked really well for the duration they worked for - 2 months -_-And it got worse after replacement. They gave a defaulted product again.Not worth the amount.
The best airpods avaliable at this price point.  Delivers above average sound quality and good play time.  Bang for the buck
"Ordered them before arriving to India like a month ago, I tried to connect them when I arrive last week and only right pair is working. Googled everything about how to connect left pair but nothing working and can't replace them either. So I'd say better buy something else"
"The sound quality is good. But there are times when the left earbud stopped working and I had to  restart the headset. This is one major defect that they Boat should look into. Bass is not to what I had expected, can be improved. I believe that the product should be priced a bit lower due to certain defects. All the defects occurred on the first day of using"
Only one star left just because of comfortBut the TWS is dope AF for it's price 1999rsDon’t buy for 2499 or above it is best for 2k in my opinion just buy and if u don’t like it just return it.
Today I got Airdope delivery within 2 days It’s worth if u have plan for true wireless buy it All is good but Bass is much strong sound quality is also goodThank YouAmazon
"• Sound quality perfect• mic very poor quality ,when sending a voice msg its make more noise than our voice also problem while calling"
"If you are buying it for music then it's okay okay... But I'm very much disappointed with the call sound quality it's very poor .... There's no noise cancellation as far as I felt while during call, unable to recognise the voice of speaker.Go for other options.."
Single conclusion .just awesom in every aspects .I loved it.Wroth for money and quality as boat is just awesome.
"Love the Quality and also the sound and bass is perfect and how can I forget about the fitting, its so comfortable in my ear. Genuinely i feel like i m using premium product."
I liked Boat airdopes 441 pro too much..I bought on prime day deal so got extra discount profit too..sound quality is awesome..
"The earbuds battery lasts only 20 odd minutes after being fully charged.Fit in ear was not the best for me, compared to some other earbuds that I have tried.Touch feature of MFB is oversensitive and pauses music / ends call with the slightest touch."
Bass is very high and sound quality is quite goodNoise cancellation is good but it is not good for calling on the BikeBattery is really goodIn these tws drivers are 6mm but it is equal to 10mm normal earphone drivers
It is not a good quality . M I replacement my product the company will approx 2 months above not to replace my product to given me it is very bad things to not provide me product this is very bad service to given me
"Worst product.  Sound quality is average, calling quality is very worst in open space, other person can't even hear you.YOU CANT HEAR YOUR INCOMING CALL AT ALL.IT IS LITTERLY GUU.Worst part is you can't return or replace this product with other one.So don't buy this earphones"
Everything is outstanding in this price rangeI recommend this one for bass lover
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 After using a month, stop working.. its founder says they are creating high quality products but it's totally worst in few months. Not working properly on calling. So, I am not going to refer my friend's and known.."
"I bought heatset one month before. It was working good for only one week After that it was empty charge not only earbuds and also box within one day. I bought this for mainly charge. But it's so disaster. If warranty takes place, I will make full stars. Solve my problems."
"Sound quality is not at all good, neither bass nor treble. Noice cencellation is also poor, touch controls also not quick responsive. Major fact not so comfortable in ear. Nobody can keep them in ear for a long while, it starts to pain all around. Not recomended"
"Just now received this boat Airdopes 441... There is some irritating noise continuously present, especially in my left dopes. It gives me headache. And no return policy. Worst buy! No scope for customer. Money wasted."
This is the worst earbud i bougbt till now the connectivity is poor it sometimes disconnect automatically.Only one earbud funcyion most of the time.Also it catches too much bass
Good sound quality and noise cancellation. Works for 3-4 hours on charge.However if I wear them long enough it starts hurting. The charging point touches your ear maybe because of that. I don't find the build as comfortable but it sure is sturdy and will not drop while running.
Excellent Product THANKS TO AMAZON... IAm Genuine review EXCELLENT BASS AND CHARGING VERY COMFORTABLE FOR EARS1.Good Adjust for ears no problem2.we ride bike also it's very comfortable no problem ....Thanqq
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Amazing sound quality if you are bass lover then defenatly go for it. After 1 month of use i m very habitual of it. Built quality is also premium"
"I liked the sound quality, the handy design. In-ear Fit is also great.But the only part that makes me think about this purchase wasn't worthy is for the calling feature. Most of the time the person on other side is unable to hear me. Also there are breakage in voice being on Call..."
Waste waste  waste.......After few days its sound stops and now one can't do anything this time.... no option from Amazon nor from boat
Overall good but poor voice calls connectivity.Battery backup hardly 2hrs.freequently fall from ears if is not fit correctly.
"Do not opt for it unless and until you are okay to afford new one within half a year.Just like every other second quality earphones, the sound quality deteriorates on one side.Thoroughly disappointed with the performance of the product."
"The airpods are good, nice sound quality and better noice cancellation, fits perfectly in my ears but the only problem is that there is Neha Kakkar on the box , I gifted this to my cousin but he rejected it by saying it has neha kakkar's photo so please change the box design otherwise it's a good earphones"
After using these airpodes for 2 months the right one stopped working and also there was a sound difference between the two ..the left airpode use to give more sound than the right one ..as a result left airpode use to run out of battery 15-20 mins before right earpode ...so just don't buy these
"Just  Dashing, awesome audio clarity....  listen  the songs ...  u  can feel  each and every beat...  mostly...the box  is fabulous. Comes with a power bank option as well  of 2000. Value for money."
"Overall product is good, Only issue i found is it can not connect with two devices at a time like mi sport ear phones. This feature is important for office to connect mobile and laptop at same time."
"The overall sound quality of the earbuds is good. But I felt that the bass is lil bit on the lower side, it doesn't mean the bass level is bad, it's just low. Also I felt that they could have improved upon the battery backup of the earbuds. Other than that the earbuds is great for the price paid."
Great pair of TWS. Got this one on the Independence Day Sale. So far so good. Highly recommended in this price range. Sound quality is top notch. So does the call quality! :)
Its customer service is very poor. I had an issue with this product so i decided to get it replaced. And i am not able to get it done.I have mailed them several times but didnt received any response from their side. I am really tensed. I am striving really hard to get it done but nothing is happening.😔😔
Used 1 monthMusic 4.5starGaming 3.5 starCalling 2.5 starBattery backup 5 star(voice cancellation is good but not able to use while using helmet becuse of the touch sensor)I am using boat bran since 2016 (boats first model basshead 225)
"Because quality of voice defect , among two piece defence exists one low and the other and biggest thing easily slipping ,so it would be best if the product has an hanging  around the auricle /ear , that is light appreciable ,bass quality differe in both one high and low"
"The product I received had the left earbud defective. Also on charging it got heated. Later I found there are heating issues with this product which haven't been solved yet. Eventually, I returned the product. However in terms of design, sound quality it was pretty good."
Pls don't go for it stop working on the 10 day and today I have to go to service centre. light are not working and headphones are not charging and I buy it for 2000 in sale and if you are taking it for pubg so pls don't go for it there is sound delay  of 1 to 2 sec so don't go for it
The sound quality is not what I expected but sill its pretty good. The build of the buds is good and sturdy. The only problem I faced is that it falls off my ear sometimes when I take it for some outdoor activities.
"These earphones are all i can say is ""okay""These are not much to expectationIf a buyer want some really good quality, then go for a neckband or wired earphones or headphones"
"Wasn't very happy with this one, keeps popping out of my ear and if i push the earphones in my ears start hurting"
"These are not exactly proper battery backup, which is shutting down for 1 to 2 hours."
Got two of these. My wife is happy with hers. The only issue i had is that the buds fall off to easily. I absolutely cant think of doing any physical activity like running etc. with these on. The sound quality is good. Probably my ears are big for this 😀
Looking Very Sexy 😍Awsm productBass is great 👌Sound quality niceBluetooth working very fastBattery is also good enough 👍Without any hesitation you go for it✌️
It is  too large to fit in my ears I have already used 255 it works better than this product andwill in call the other person is not able to listen my voiceas the mic is in my ear it is receiving very low and other person can not hear your voice loud
Really awesome product feom boat and nice delivery feom amazon.. go for it guys.. connection is good.. sound quality is good.. its a no doubt product.. works better at 50-70%volume.. noise cancelation and bass above that is little unclear.. other than that it's gets full marks
This is for bass heads. The bass this thing produces is amazing for people who love bass.
"Please dont buy this. I am facing issue of crakling noise in both earbuds, when u pause music and listen carefully you can hear crakling noise .... I have replaced item 2 times still am getting same issue... service of amazon is good.."
Few Issues Regarding Whatsapp Call and Duo.Connection problem Occurs On internet based Calls. It automatically switches to Phone Speaker. Overall Build quality may have become more better.
"*microphone of left eardope is not working, *sound quality is too low, even 50rs earphones have better sound quality than this boat airdopes.*could not hear other person voice*connection breaks within few metersInshort, it has no other use than listening to music kepping your phone aside."

 Bad product its not working don't buy it and waste your money on it"
"Sound quality is good and bass quality is good but it is too sensitive , while lying down even small touch of pillow can switch it off and lighting system in both works differently and it confuses"
The sound is good and it’s good value for money. The only problem is that the touch controls are very annoying due to accidental touches.
Nice productLoses connection for a second many timesCall quality average..Nice thing is it’s cute and handy..
"It's not 🚫 fit for someone who have small ear ... And it's very pain full for small ear people ...then , sound quality is really good , more than enough !! The capacitive touch control is very sensitive so that is sometimes if we unknowingly touched it , it will be cancel ❌ , ( especially when we are using for call purpose !! ) ....."
The worst thing you could buy.Sound and all is ok.But the charging sucks.Sometimes it gets charged sometimes it won't.Sometimes it will show fully charged and it will say battery low in 1 minutes....!
"This is a very good product. I bought it for my marathon office meeting on zoom. Somehow it failed because sound quality was not good for personal listening to me on the other side. So, I opted for return. I like the touch machanism, it is very sensitive."
The sound is too low. Bass is almost absent. Even at full volume it is struggle to listen if two people are talking sitting mext to you. Extremely disappointed with boat. Not expected it to sound like bose but it is worse than local store products
Superb...nice ad clear sound...lovely bass not high ad not low... parfect👌🏻..if u watch movie u feel just amezing..i get this 2499...1 day delivary very fast..😘
"Itz a nice product bt it is not worthy for calling purpose.it can be only used for gaming,music and videos.bass quality is good.the main drawback is its not suitable while walking or outdoor activities bcz it may lost(size is too small)Bass ans sound quality is good"

 Don't buy this worst product within a month one ear bud not working for 10minutes also. Highly recommended not to buy boat441pro"
The product is amazing sound quality is devine no doubt any that but noise cancellation is crap plus the customer service is just pathetic man really trying to contact em but not possible always says budy plus filed complaint but no response yet
"It's very nice to used, I think you should go for it. Its features makes it very special. Just one thing manufacturers forgot to add to control of volume via buds & Noise Cancellation is low. Else, everything is okay. Please go for it👍."
Sound quality is not good it don't feel like music it seems like speech you are hearing
I really worried before buying this product but after using it for couple of months I am a really happy customer after 10 months of use.
It is not compatible with Mac product. Battery dies quickly. Charging pod does not work properly. Even the replacement  does not function as hoped.
The product is really good. Compact and fits perfectly. Sound quality is nice. But if ur a bass lover it’s not sufficient. Wake to connect doesn’t works sometimes and you have to connect manually. Overall good product. I would recommend.
Duplicate product received. Ordered and returned the product two times and i received fake product both the time. Amazon refused to replace with the another original product for which i have paid amazon....flipkart is better than amazon while handling customer support
"Boat delivers the best airdope in 2500/-, don''t use while driving, if you plug in both ear then cant hear any audio from out side.cons:- ear pains if you use for more than one hour."
"If u like to listen old musics then it may be not for u ...coz its terrible is bit low.. if you are riding a bike then ur voice may not be audible to the other person during phone calls.. used it for 1 year , no problem till now . Battery life is also good"
Sound quality is bestNoice cancellation is good but best among other brandsThe range of TWS are also good 15 m approximately they run good then after it quite faded sound comes. Its best anyone who wants to buy TWS just go for it in this range.
"Sound quality is good, but they stop charging after few months. I claimed for warranty. They accepted, and assigned to Imagine Marketing services pvt Ltd. This third party again arranged pick up. Delivery boy from DELHIVERY came and picked up my product. But till date I am unable track where my product is."
"Sound quality, looks, casing, fit - all great...But the weirdest part is that sometimes there's a slight loss of connectivity of when I keep the phone in my pocket and keep walking.This is irritating to say the least.P.S. Connectivity when the phone is outside is good."

 Blindly one can buy. Got it for 2499/-Thanq Amazon, thanq boat."
The airdopes are without a doubt...so good...Mine stopped working after 12 days... I used only one airdopes but all of a sudden both stop working out of nowhere... I raised a compliant on boat website... It got replaced... It's been few days it's working Okay...
"Sound quality is good but microphone quality is not good. But if you are buying it for calls and meetings then it is worthless as other person won't be able to hear your voice clearly. For music and video purpose, it is awesome. It would be better if mic was powerful."
I complained about 6 weeks back that one of the Boat Airdopes is not charging at all. I seent it back and it returned (after repair). The same right piece is not charging again. The problem is persistent.
Don't Purchase Online.Because after replacment I got same defective piece as first one .So I decide to change it from Boat Service Center.Because I have to gift someone.So I don't have any choice
"Bass is not perfect.We have to put the volume to 80% for good bass. If we put volume to 100% song lyrics won't hear.Perfect fitting.Charging Ok.Nice Case.Sound & Noise Cancellation is Ok.Good one with in Rs 2,500."
"Actually, this product was good but it's not fit for who have the smaller earholes. That's why I was returned this item."
"After used approx. 20 days. I didn't get any issue. By the way,great experience.Sound quality is perfect.Fitting is perfect.Battery life is perfect.On calls it works perfectly.I bought it 1999rs only."
"It is good at the price range. There are some flaws like it connects sometimes even the buds are in tha case and while in the call the mic is very poor. The other person cannot hear even we talk somewhat slow. Other than that, the built quality and sound quality  is good and the bass is good."
i purchased this after reading reviews but unfortunately these earpods are not for Voice Calling.person from other side wont hear anything while you are walking.Disappointed with this drawback

 I have been using this product of the boat for about 5 months, this product is absolutely useless,touch sensor are also rubbish type,have studied it comparatively to other products like this. Its sound is very suppressed. Absolutely useless by the price."
"Bought in December 2020, it's not even completed 2months sound is not working. I tried in different devices even though sounds are not working"
Everything is good in this earphone but I mainly brought it for calling purpose and find so many difficulties during the call. if you are a low pitch voice person..this earphone is not for u.So my calling experience was not good after 1-week use I returned it.
Go for pro variant be cause this one's airdopes battery life is 4-5 hours... on single chrg.Sound wise it is goodBass is goodFitting is okayNo noice cancellationAnd hurts ears too in more than an hour of
"Sound quality is below average, latency is more than 700 ms, no bass, no noise cancellation, ear gets irritated after couple of minutes. Worst product!"
"The product is quite good for normal usage. The most important thing is its battery backup,it's superb. Charging time from 0-100% is around 1hour. And full battery backup along with the buds and case is around 30 hours."
"After using a month1-Sound quality is good but you can not wear it till 1 hour , you will feel pain in ears after some time.2- Calling quality is very bad you have to speak louder every time you can not talk normal or slowly with this TWS3-battery backup is good"
"I really liked the the sound quality of this one,but I have some issues with it such as the earbuds are not turned off even after I put them in the case and sometimes the right bud doesn't work properly,Other than that it is one of the best in the segment"
Review after one year: The sound of the earphones is not as loud as I expected. The battery life of the ear buds has been really pathetic there is 80 percent charge on one ear bud while the other one drains out overall the ear buds are not reliable at all
"touch controls not working and replacement hasn't been started from boat's end yet. will update the review if I actually do get a working replacement.Sound quality is good but ctc did not work even in the replacement, it's just not sensitive enough."
Very bad product 1 side of ear pod is not working and company did not reply for email also. Given 1 star otherwise review would not list
"The dopes are great for a music lover, however not so much for somebody who's working from home and has to be on Teams or Zoom meetings. The mic is not great at all."
BoAt Airdpes and real dope you can buy the it's good for when you're working out and there is a picture that I've uploaded I'm a fashion photographer and those both pictures clicked by me ( Mohd Shahrukh Siddiqui )
"Please do not invest on these pair of earbuds they r the worst the sound quality was bad,when I pause my music there is a wierd noise coming out of it,I used these pair for 15 days and the left earbud stopped working when i play it at full vol I could hear the left side at vol 10.It was my worst investment on a earphone"
"i will never suggest to buy anyone because when you talk to someone over the phone, listener not able to listen, i had taken 2 month back this product, left wireless pods not working so lots of issue in this headphone.  i would suggest don't waste your money on this."
The product quality was good.but it seems not fit in my ears.. Noise cancellation was nice.and it think one ear bud can give nice experience.. Im using earbuds without its ear flags..
"Sound quality is good with heavy bass but noise cancellation is non existent while calling in out door and I really don’t think the case battery is 2600 mAh because earphones lasted only for 20 hours with charging case and I had charged it fully before testing, specs-bait"
Its not working properlyBluetooth turnoff automaticallyIt discount automaticallyMic is poorI was buy in big billion baysAmazon was given half and product was half manufactured productsDon't buy in big billion dayThey selling damaged peices
"Sound & bass quality is good but facing issue with one earbud after two months of use. No led indication after removed from case even it is full charged. Registered complain with BOAT, waiting for this issue to get resolve"
Now it is selling at less than 2000 and I bought it at 2499/- but overall a decent sound quality product.
"Suddenly after 1 month of use, sound drastically reduced.  Now at full volume, it sounds like someone is speaking at the background.  If you start concentrating on such low sound, your ear would hurt. Very disappointed.  Not expected this from a Boat product."
i dont know much how to judge sound quality but its durable and sounds good to me.

 Nice product 1 week battery capacity super sounds system ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
Microphone quality is very poor cannot be used for calls at all.
One bud is not working properly and it has very low sound so I returned the productMy friend has same product but it's quality is good so plz check and buy
There is no noise cancellation.  There is a big issue in calling soo much  othere side they hear lots of noise and loud alot more and I wana return it but there is no return policy there is just replace policy
Sound is goodBass is okNoice cancellation is goodGot extra different size budsOnly thing is charging case is bit big n bulky because of its 2600 mah capacity
Using this product since past 5 monthsVery quick delivery by AmazonGood product by boatYou can use it for 2-3 hrs per chargeMicrophone is not goodBass quality-9/10Battery-5/10Value for money-7/10Noice cancellation-9/10Charging is fast
"Made in China product, quality is not that good. Frequent connection issues - disconnecting frequently while it's on and sometimes not getting disconnected on putting in the box."
Sound is pretty good... WhatsApp audios might be distorted occasionally... serves it's purpose... customer service is really good... trust boAt... no the light doesn't shine all the time only when it's in the charging pod or if you're handling it manually
"Sound quality is fantastic, and the build material is also good. Gives a really long battery backup. More than 5hrs in earbuds. And 30+ hours in the case. Bass is also good. I would recommend to anyone buying earbuds."

 It's really IWP sound is amazing bass is amazing noice cancelation is also there...worth the money and design is also amazing and the thing i loved about it was the power bank function...love it and satisfied.♥"
I am using this airdopes last one month then I write review if you want only music then you buy this but when talk about phone call worst experience and after one month they disconnect and stop music automatically so please don't waste your money on this
Actually product is very good.. But it have a common problem that reset...kv kv aawaz nhi aayega to finger se teen baar press kr reset krna pdega... To excellent work krne lagega... Baki sab okay h.. But jise ye function pata n hoga wo sochega bekaar h..
Pehli baar just ye product kharida to usme se right wale earbud me se unwanted noice aa rahi thi..mene replace karvaya.. new product aaya usme bhi same problem hai.. kya karu me ab iska.. i want my money back.. please contact me.  any how i need solution
"This is good just for listening to music,Bluetooth range is very bad hardly 6mtsLot of echo during the callsBattery life is badYou can't charge your mobile (one plus phone)NOTE:-Don't buy if you want to use it for office meeting purpose."
If you not to buy a good tws under 2 thousand then I suggest you to buy boat 381 from flipkart ........
there's no sound even after linking to the bluetooth is it a defective piece recvd
"Worst purchase ever offline or online. Waste of money and time. Ruined diwali gift.Received and checked left side bud was not working. Now, amazon is simply denying to replace or return.I suggest never use this portal to purchase electronic item. Flipkart is more convenient option."
Don't go for this product.  This is rubbish.  One of the eardope (left) stopped working for me after two months from the date of delivery.  Didn't expected this.
Great for music during a gym workout! Mine let me concentrate so well that I saved half an hour during my workout session.
"Pros- better bass, sturdy built quality, long battery life .Cons- poor mic quality.. needs a calm surrounding otherwise sound goes very poor on the other end"
"The product was really good when i first started using it, after 7 to 8 months the battery life started to decrease. Now the right side will work for an hour tops and then it would power off.So not that recommended."
"I would give honest feedback- Most Imp, poor bluetooth connectivity. You’ve to try 2-3 times to connect- Good sound quality- Good Bass- No issue in charging"
"I have been using this Airdrops about year now.it fit perfectly and don't feel like you wear it.Sound quality is also good battery like if quite good, i daily use them all day long.good purchase happy with product"
"Writing this review after 6 months of use, the left airpods is now playing at extremely low volume. Would not recommend this product at such high cost."
The earbud stopped working I raised the complain twice once it got exchanged with the wrong product then requested for replacement and the product that was delivered is defective.... trying to connect with the customer care but not getting proper response or results... I request Amazon to kindly solve this issue.
"It is good to listen music and other audio. But if you want to make a phone call then it disappoint you, because when you speak your voice will go very slow to your other end partner. And sometimes voice will break even you have good network."
"See it's a genuine review...so earphones are quite good but not up to the mark , firstly bass is not as good as quoted in tagline,it doesn't have active noise cancellation neither passive and sound quality is also not that impressive for 2.7k...i would have been really happy if this was somewhat near 1k 😂"
"You cannot ask for anything more from this brilliant TWS at this price range .Sound quality is great .Highs are very good , lows could have been a little better .Bass is powerfull and noise cancellation too is verr good. it's fitting is also very well.fully satisfied.4 out of 5 stars."
"A good buy, decent 4 hr life at full battery, case charge it for around 5-6 times, and ok ok grip in ear.Sometimes left earplug disconnects automatically, reconnect only after restarting."
There are massive connectivity issues with the airdopes. Many times only one of the airdopes connects and it goes in the mono mode. Tried factory reset and all other options. It doesnt work. Pathetic product. Avoid buying it even if given at low price.
Product is good and worth for that price. I am using this since August 2020 and it has been 5-6 months and there is no defect observed.The only problem I faced is sometimes mic doesn't work. May be that is because of connectivity problem with my mobile or laptop.
Finally got better...i have tried more brand at this price range but this is better..and ambrane beatsdeo is also good one...its better than airdopes 281.
DO NOT BUY IT....I Would not give even 1 star rating for it Poor quality eardopes from Boat....it worked fine for 1 months....later right earbud stopped working completely....don't know how to get repaired it....can Amazon help....
During call sound get distorted like network problem but its always fine without TWS. Plz look into it. Els its the best for entertainment.
"getting issue with media sound..not getting sound from youtube or downloaded mp3, video..only call sound i can heare.."
"I would like to express my sincerest disappointment with the Indian brand Boat for sending me two really mediocre quality products which did not work. As you can see for yourself the right airdope does not work.Apparently I ordered the replacement which adhered to the quality of ""not working"". This consistency is commendable.  Bravo."
"This product is not so good as per reviews. I had read them and purchase this. But this products sound quality is an average okay,  After some time the Bluetooth hurt ears, and fill uncomfortable. So I had return  it, but they gave me replacement. No refund policy."
"The only thing lacking is one airpodes light is not working well, even after replacing the item. It is same. And it took some time to connect (for 1 airpode only). So be patient with it."
Everything was good untill it was workingNow the product is not working and there customer executives aren't respondingWhen I went to their office in cilil lines PrayagrajThey told me to come 15 day later and they are just changing the date still
Although it is good but sometimes 1 or the either airpods stops working and i have to put it back in the charging case so that it works again..If you want to talk on phone while using the earpods it will not work as the background noise will be very much
Colours shown in the app is misleading. Actually it is yellow in colour . But in picture it shows flurescent green . I needed a flourescent green colour. Now am using the ear caps and ear holdings of old tws. Yellow colour was not shown clearly instead flurescent green is shown.
"not proper fit in-ear.i am not satisfied with this headphone, it will  remove automatically from air and not user ear-friendly as my experience"
"Not suggesting for call, you can buy it to use for music purposes.Call issue- Voice is not audiable to other side, voice is breaking continuously.No return policy is making this product worthless."
"After searching for too many TWS finally I bought these n I'm fully satisfied with this purchase.. sound quality is great👍🏻✌🏻, decent battery life,so punchy bass,, Don't fall for negative reviews..I have ordered 2more for my brother n friend..THE ONLY REGRET IS ITS MADE IN CHINA 🙁🙁🙁"
The casing is little boxy but still okay to carry around .touching takes time to get connected. Pairing is okay.Sound quality is good enough .Battery is very good.
"Worst product of my life, when i use boat airdropes 441 during call, its keep disconnecting again and again, i changed it once from service center within 1 month of buying but the issue is same, i am using mi note 10. If anyone have some solution then please share"
Im really disappointed as the sound quality is very bad. I thought i got damaged product and replaced it again bt still the sound was same. Now this product cant be returned also...my money has been wasted.I bought this after seeing the reviews bt i no more trust the reviews.
If you want to use it for music or video it is very good...but for calls I'll its worst. Too much noise for other person they will never get wt you said. Very bad experience.
